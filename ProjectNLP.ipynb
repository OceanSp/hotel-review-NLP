      "We stayed one night prior to our early flight at the end of our vacation in Sedona. We did not want to make the two hour drive from Sedona so early in the morning so we booked one night here. I have stayed in airport hotels before so frankly did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were spacious. Front desk was very helpful. We returned our car when we arrived and took the car rental shuttle to the airport and was picked up (in less than 10 minutes). Then in the morning took the shuttle back to the airport. Very seamless and quick service. The breakfast was wonderful. Again we were not expecting much but was very surprised. My husband even personally thanked the woman who was putting out the breakfast since everything was very good and much more than you usually get at an airport hotel. My husand ate so much breakfast he skipped lunch that day. So if you are looking for a great airport hotel this is it. We arrived by plane, early evening and were shuttled by the Holiday Inn van to the hotel. The van arrived in a timely manner and check in at the hotel was provided by a courteous desk clerk. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was included the following morning and was an excellent assortment of breakfast items. Without a doubt I would stay at this hotel again. When we arrived the night before our scheduled departure by plane the next morning, the desk clerk informed us they had secure, surveillance parking spots where we could leave our vehicle for two weeks. We payed extra for parking. We checked our vehicle the next morning early before we left and verified that the doors were locked. The very next afternoon we had a phone call from the Arizona DPS that our vehicle had been located in the desert out by Gila Bend (100 miles from the hotel) abandoned with much damage. We were stunned. It has been a night mare dealing with this situation. A few days later we tried to use our credit card and it was rejected because of suspected fraudulent charges. Someone had accessed our card number. The only recent use of the card was at the same hotel. Do you suppose that maybe this entire event was an \"inside job\"? My stay was two weeks ago and from the moment I arrived the front desk staff members were extremely helpful. They provided excellent recommendations on attractions and then the Manager on Duty, *I believe his name was Bill* provided some restaurants. This was truly an amazing experience and I when I return to Phoenix in a few months, this Holiday Inn has my business.\n",
      "Thank you HI staff! My son and I stayed at the Phoenix airport Holiday Inn so we could catch a 5:30 AM plane. We arrived before 10:00 PM and stood in line behind another party. We waited and waited and waited. The bartender did not know where the receptionist was. Some 20 minutes later she popped from behind a panel and without a word checked us all in. Since we had to leave around 4:00 AM I asked if the bill would appear under our door very early in the morning. I was told that they were delivered very early. Not! I had to ask for a receipt on our way out (fortunately there was a recptionist there).\n",
      "Although I was doubly dissapointed with the service, this Holiday Inn seemed very typical. I wrote a Holiday Inn review, so hopefully the problems I encountered have been resolved for future visitors. We strive to rate properties verus their peers, inthis case upper-mid-level interior-entry motor hotels with elevators.\n",
      "Just what we needed after a long drive from northern AZ and prior to an early start the next morning for the flight back to the east coast. Nothing special, but a clean, well appointed good-size room, quiet and efficient AC, very good soundproofing for the planes, great pool, helpful staff. A bit more than we usually spend but less than most of the competing places equally close to the airport. Not a great neighborhood and not much int he way of dining options but can't really blame the facility for that. We can't rate the breakfast because we had to leave too early. I had a very good stay in a corner king suite with sofa bed, wet bar, two TVs and two a/c units. My travel companion likes the Waffle House chain and there is one in the hotel parking lot. I stayed for two nights, and left a tip for housekeeping the morning after the first night, which the staff did not touch. I left the tip again the morning after the second night at check-out. The funniest thing, when I used the remote to turn off one TV, it turned on the other one! My only complaint, the scrambled eggs (at the hotel, not at the Waffle House) were just so-so. Stayed one night after a long flight. I had emailed hotel before I arrived to sort out the airport shuttle but the phones at the airport seemed to be malfunctioning - or maybe it was me after a long flight! ( No it WAS the phones!!) However contacted the hotel via the info desk and the schuttle was perfect and quick. No problems at checkin and room was clean and comfortable ( and quiet) No problems at all. Breakfast was very good ( except plastic cuttelry but not a major problem) . Swimming pool very welcome way to keep awake and avoid jet lag. The location is isolated with not much around it but that is not uncommon for an airport hotel. Would I say again - Yes After working all week in Northern AZ I drove to Phoenix to spend the night before flying out the next day. I was exhausted and really wanted some quiet time and a good nights sleep. I got that at this hotel. There was a mistake on my booking but the front desk staff took care of it right away. My room was clean, cool and quiet. Starving, I was happy to find a Waffle House on the property so a quick meal and a a nice evening and night in the room. Stayed one night with baby before flight the next morning.\n",
      "Pros: Had a real crib for the baby (not just pack n play). Really easy to fuel and return rental car. Rooms were clean and looked recently remodeled. Staff (for the most part, see below about the reservation) were super friendly and helpful. Bed was SO comfortable, it was lovely. Mini fridge actually kept things at a real fridge temp (important since we had medication that required real refrigeration). Breakfast was standard for the chain and tasty (except I was puzzled by the lack of fruit).\n",
      "Cons: A/C struggled mightily to make room temperature comfortable for us. We turned it to max cool when we arrived and an hour later we were still uncomfortable. It didn't get right until the sun went down a few hours later. Granted, we're from Minnesota so our idea of comfortable is fairly low and it is really hot there in summer, but other rooms on our trip kept up so I don't think it was an unreasonable expectation.\n",
      "Also, when I called front desk to book I specifically asked about a suite with a door between the bedroom area and the living room area and the guy suggested the suite type - after check-in, I was disappointed when the room only had a little tiny half-wall. I mentioned specifically how we like having a way to shut a door between us and where the baby is sleeping so I was surprised the guy didn't understand my request. It was easy enough to follow our other tactic (put her in the corner and rig up the comforter to block light for her), so I wasn't really upset or anything. But, it wasn't what I thought I was getting. So for the record, if you're booking a junior suite, there is NOT a door between the two areas. Stayed here for one night after a long flight into the US. Staff were helpful. The rooms are above-average compared to others in the HI Express chain and we didn't suffer any airport noise. Location is great for a night before/night after flight, but a bit isolated for anything else - only restaurant in the vicinity is a Waffle House which also gave us great service but only offered fast-food options (burgers and fry-ups) - OK for 1 night but not so good if we had been staying around longer. 7/30- 8/10/ 2012\n",
      "Jake Bayer- thanks for making my second stay even more special than the first. I was having such a long Monday and not only was he very courteous, he offered me some drinks from the consession because he knew I didn't like alcohol. The rooms and amenities were up to usually HI Expess quality. I will definitely stay at this hotel anytime I am in Phoenix\n",
      "Actually all the staff members are very friendly.\n",
      "It is so freaking hot in Phoenix, the air conditioner by the door at check in blowing cold air was a added bonus; When you travel as much as I do, it is the little things this the aforementioned that matters. I love the pressure of the shower head as well. This is a a complaint at most hotels Very convenient near the airport. I was initially concerned about hearing planes all night with being near the airport, but it wasn't a problem at all. Great place to stay! We recently stayed at this hotel June 23 & 24 and July 1, at the beginning and end of our Arizona Trip. Our family of our enjoyed our stays. First the hotel is located about 5 minutes from the hotel. When we arrived in Phoenix it picked us up within 10 minutes of our call. it was a quick drive to the hotel, although past a bunch of gentle men's clubs. Not the best scenery. Checkin was quick at this four floor hotel. We were assigned to a fourth floor room.Although the room did not smell of smoking, the hallway does. Our return visit had us on the third floor with a clean smelling hallway. The pool was nice and had pool towels available. The breakfast. Was includes and offered pancakes eggs, Danish And a meat. The orange juice was very weak, not much more then orange flavored water. My wife liked the coffee. The hotel has one washer and dryer. Each cycle was one dollar and detergent was available. The shuttle was nice and got us to the airport in plenty of time. it leaves on the half hour until 11am and then as needed. it will also get you to nearby restaurants and for us the nearby lite rail station to get us to the baseball field. Overall a very nice place for a family and for people like us where it was our first time to the area. Located in the business district it is business person's ideal location being close to many business and roadways that allow a person to get to places easily throughout the Phoenix area. Also being in a close location to the airport it is definitely a place for a person to stay if they had an extended lay over at the phoenix airport. The hotel amenites were good. Hotel does need some tender loving but nothing that a little spit and polish would not take care of. by the way the happy during the week for hotel guests is a nice touch and i would encourage continuance of that service to include sunday evenings. The only other suggestions is to have th breakfast stay open to its posted time of 930. Often the breakfast was closed at 915 and there were still guests coming to enjoy the breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful which made our stay very enjoyable. The room was clean and comfortable with effective air conditioning. \n",
      "The complimentary breakfast was excellent with a great selection of food and beverages.\n",
      "We used the pool which was rarely very busy. A few more parasols would have been nice to provide more shade, as the heat ( in excess of 100F) and sun were intense.\n",
      "For us, the hotel was in an ideal spot for the places we wanted to visit in Phoenix and very convenient for the airport.\n",
      "We will not hesitate to stay here again when we next visit Phoenix. The staff at this hotel were so very nice. The rooms were very clean. We would stay there again. I have stayed at this airport hotel a number of times, mainly because my office is literally across the street. So I just get the airport shuttle service and walk to work when working in Phoenix, and don't need to rent a car. I've always enjoyed my stays at the hotel; it's a holiday inn express and nothing fancy, but the staff is always friendly and great and it just provides you everything you really need when staying at an airport hotel. Some notes:\n",
      "-Free WIFI (although if you stay in rooms at the end of the hallways you will get a really weak signal and will probably need to use the wired option)\n",
      "-Elevator (only one in the place and it takes forever; I would request a room on the 1st floor or 2nd, as there are stairs in the main lobby to take you right up there. Avoid the elevator)\n",
      "-Free breakfast and a happy hour every evening during the week if you are a member of the hotel rewards program (they give you 2 cards for 2 free drinks, I believe)\n",
      "-Free parking\n",
      "-Not much to eat in walking distance (the Hilton next door has a restaurant which is decent and this is what provides the holiday inn room service; there is a waffle house in front of the hotel, but it houses possibly the greasiest food I've ever eaten....that's about all your options within walking distance).\n",
      "-Good TVs with a bunch of channels offered.\n",
      "-Free Shuttle Airport Service (the drivers are really friendly; leaving the hotel is every 30 mins and I've always had good luck with that. But picking you up at the airport is a different story - they usually take forever! You have to call them to pick you up, so I recommend doing it while waiting for your bag or when you get off the plane if you just have a carry-on.)\n",
      "Overall, cheap rates for large rooms. You get great service and a lot of free features as well. I'd recommend it if you stay in the Phoenix airport area. The staff was friendly, the price was right, and the location was excellent. A great place to stay near the airport and the ASU campus. The light rail station was only about 5 miles away, which was very convenient for going into the downtown for a Diamondbacks game. There was only one restaurant within walking distance that we saw, but there were many choices close to campus. I'd definitely stay here again! We spent in this hotel two nights: one after arriving and one before leaving Arizona. Its proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and accessibility made it an attractive choice as a step stone in our travel plans.\n",
      "The airport and the car rental facility are within 15 minutes, fast and easy drive from the hotel, which has its own shuttle service as well. We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and uncomplicated. From the airport, you can call for free the shuttle service, to let them know where they can pick you up.\n",
      "Rooms are spacious, clean, with everything you would need and expect. Although noise was not something we would complain about, it's a fact, probably the extra \"price\" you need to pay for staying there. Other than that, there is nothing except the A/C unit that disturbed our rest. We had to turn it completely off, the fan was far too loud.\n",
      "Breakfast was standard to poor in term of choices, but just fine to get the day started. Probably not my choice for a breakfast restaurant though. What a wonderful find! I will be using this property again for pre and/or post flights from Phoenix. Jake checked us in and gave us the quiet room we had asked for. They had cocktails at happy hour for Priority Club members, as well as snacks. The room was well-appointed. Good air conditioning (which is important when it is 112 degrees outside!), everything you could need in the bathroom, nice large flatscreen TV, etc. They had free wi-fi in the room and a computer in the lobby for checking email or printing boarding passes. Starting at 6 am, they had breakfast as well. I was told it was a \"continental breakfast\" which for me means cereal and danish, but really it was SO much more! There were hot cinnamon rolls, ready-to-make pancakes, a variety of juices, milks and yoghurts, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, etc. Wow! Everything we needed. They even had a park and airport shuttle program. I definitely recommend this hotel! We only spent a night here after a long flight into Phoenix, before setting off on a road trip around the national parks. Our room was on the 4th floor and overlooked an ugly parking lot / industrial area, but it was on the quiet side of the hotel (as requested) so we were happy.\n",
      "The room itself was very spacious with the largest bathroom I've ever seen at a HI. We had an excellent night's sleep on a firm king-size bed. The complimentary breakfast was standard hotel fare and I only ever take a piece of fruit anyway.\n",
      "Our shuttle driver, James, was fantastic. We were only collecting our car the next day so we had no transport, but wanted to visit a local Mexican restaurant. James offered to take and fetch us from there \"just for tips\"', which was much nicer and cheaper than calling a taxi.\n",
      "All in all, a very convenient, comfortable and affordable place to stay in Phoenix. After a long flight from London, we stayed the night at this hotel. Booking in was friendly and quick. The room was a reasonable size and everywhere was very clean. Comfortable bed and not noisy at night. You can get a good light meal next door at the Hilton Hotel. The breakfast was complementary but very good...bacon, scrambled eggs,fruit, yogurts,cereals,toast and cakes. I would stay there again! Over the last 8 months, we have stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels from the East Coast to Arizona and this was by far the only one that was a let down. Although it seems fairly newer, just seemed dark and dreary throughout the building. The room was average and nothing spectacular compared to all the others. \n",
      "Breakfast buffet was alright but it is located in such a narrow area and when you have more than 4 people in the area, it is utter chaos.\n",
      "The only GREAT plus to this place was the front desk clerk. He was extremely friendly to us and recommended a great place to eat dinner just up the road with great steaks. \n",
      "Overall, it's not a bad hotel, but I expected more compared to the others in the chain that we had stayed in. Background info: platinum status; didn't use shuttle, pool; parking lot generally full; breakfast standard HI Express fare; only one elevator in the building so always slow\n",
      "The suite room contained a ton of natural light from big windows especially in the morning which was great for waking up and getting work done in the morning. Suite is open layout with no separating doors from living to bedroom area. Kitchenette sits right at entry doorway and has very little working room (between the coffee pot and other stuff sitting on the counter, there's almost no room for your own stuff). Small fridge sufficient for keeping items cold. Microwave on the older side but does its job. HVAC is a spit system set into the windows. Found it best to run them when not in room and turn off once you're back in room - that way the room is cool but there's no loud fan blowing at you. Air coming out of units are a bit musty.\n",
      "Have stayed at the other airport location as well. Would stay at this one over the other one because enjoyed the light in the room better and appreciated the complimentary breakfast. We wanted a hotel near the airport and chose this based on tripadvisor reviews. It was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. We booked a park and fly option and left our car in their parking lot, which worked out very well for us. The hotel is easy to find. The rooms are nice, it was quiet, and the beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was the \"hotel bar\", which is actually in the Hilton Garden Inn next door and owned by the same company (IHG). The pleasant and apologetic bartender did not have the ingredients for our first two cocktail requests and we finally settled for a gin and tonic with lemon because he did not have limes -- so wake up, management! This hotel is close to the airport and easy to get to. We needed to return a rental car...front desk had printed directions for us. It was very easy to get to...only a few mins. drive. There was a computer in the lobby we used to print boarding passes. Our room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was nice. Quick check-in and out. Nice, friendly staff. Free wi-fi in room. Breakfast options were good.\n",
      "We did order room service and it took over an hour to get. \n",
      "Overall, nice option for being close to the airport. I had to catch a flight out of the country early on a Monday. I stayed at this HI Express and the room was perfectly clean, wake-up call on time, and shuttle trip to the PHX airport was timely. The breakfast area was clean and efficient. \n",
      "The room was a suite so it was marvelous. There was so much room!\n",
      "The shuttle driver was exceptionally friendly.\n",
      "I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Stayed here for 3 nights while we went to Brewers Spring Training. Very friendly staff. OK breakfast. Close to Tempe, and university restaurants/scene. Easy access to Rt. 10 to / from the game. Less than 30 minutes from Old Towne Scottsdale. \n",
      "Best part, they have an airport shuttle. I've had to go to this hotel 3 times for business. It's fair, but I have a few complaints. The room service is sloppy, the restaurant is mediocre, the shuttle is not always on time (made me late for work), and they missed my wakeup calls on this last trip 3 days out of 7. My wife and I stayed here to be close to the airport for a next-day departure. \n",
      "The proximity of the hotel to I-10 and the Phoenix Airport car rental facility was most helpful. The friendly and courteous desk attendant provided us with printed directions to the nearest gas station (so we could fill the tank before returning our rental), as well as the route to the rental facility, which was actually at the very next exit off I-10 to the west.\n",
      "The whole facility was clean and inviting. No evidence of wear and tear anywhere.\n",
      "The standard king bed room was spacious enough, equipped with refrigerator and microwave, and very clean and attractive. We had no problem sleeping -- the firmness of the mattress was just right. I did get annoyed a bit by some constant noise from the refrigerator (during regular operation, not just the cooling cycle) but that kind of thing is easily remedied (so long as one does not need to keep anything cool) by pulling the plug on it. Another option is to run the room fan constantly.\n",
      "For those who don't need a fancy meal, there is a Waffle House just a couple hundred feet away. And, of course, the Hot Start breakfast buffet in the hotel lobby, with a wide variety of offerings. We found scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, Cinnamon Rolls, and cereal, among other choices. \n",
      "This HIE ranks right near the top of Holiday Inn Express properties at which we have stayed over the years, and there have been a few -- I am a Priority Club member and tend to look first for this chain when seeking lodging. we stayed here for 6 nights,it was wonderful. well appointed rooms, super clean and new, great pool. decent restaurant food for a hotel above average and great location to get to all areas of the city...will return again next year....oh and they have a shuttle to arizona mills mall!!! Absolutely positive experience. The staff is excellent, professional, friendly, helpful. Our room was comfortable, neat and clean with complimentary wi-fi. The free breakfast was good and fresh. The Park and Fly option was very helpful, we found our car to be safe and secure upon our return. The free airport shuttle was right on time and is available for late night airport pickups with just a phone call. I stayed here during a business trip for several days and enjoyed this place. The room was nice and clean, comfortable bed, and wonderful free continental breakfast....no complaints at all!!! It was nice being so close to the airport as well! I like the hotel feel. Friendly staff. Good continental breakfast. The location is convenient for the airport but it is in a poor neighborhood. Not much to do in walking distance and people looks weird.\n",
      "10 minutes drive to west brings you to Tempe where you can find good restaurant.\n",
      "My mattress was beat up so I had to sleep far from the TV and it was acceptable there. Most people sit and sleep in front of the TV and this is where it sinks the most. We spent one night to be near the airport for our morning flight. Staff members were helpful and knowledgeable. Room was typical for HI Express--roomy and pretty clean. Breakfast was again typical--enough variety to have something for everyone. The rooms are worn out. Jeez, the door knobs barely work... staff is young and attractive but utterly clueless. Not a clean or welcoming hotel. We stayed here just for one night. Very convenient location: it was perfect for next day travel (we arrived from Italy and next day a flight to Hawaii) ... so tired and the bed was very confortable ! Room was clean and quiet!\n",
      "Breakfast was fine, shuttle service great and check in very quickly!\n",
      "A great place to stay for overnight and travel from/to Phoenix We arrived earlier than expected and they gave us our room right away anyway. The room was clean and similar to other HIE. The breakfast was good, as expected. I loved that they had a computer hooked up to a printer, so we could print our boarding passes before going to the airport. We stayed the night we arrived in Arizona and the night before we got our flight home. It was very convenient for us. We will stay here again. The location and the facilities were great.\n",
      "The food was good.\n",
      "The staff was helpful and attentive especially Brian, one of the wait staff. Although the stay started with a bump - no wi-fi & their internet went down - so there was a bit of a trouble finding a decent place to eat & things to do, it's a good place overall. \n",
      "They have a decent room service, the place is very clean, & the outdoor jacuzzi that stays open until 11pm is VERY nice. There is also a great place outside the entrance called \"The Waffle House\" - we got a great cup of tea & pumpkin pie there. Convenient location. Very friendly staff. Spotless rooms. We left our car for a nominal fee - saved alot on airport parking. Gym, free breakfast was great. Shuttle driver was awesome...he showed up at the airport within 15 minutes with a smile on his face. Highly recommend hotel for next day travel. A totally positive experience. Will stay every time I travel from Phoenix. Airport lodging is usually nothing to write home about, but this H.I. Express beat those odds! We had a pleasant overnight there in a large, comfortable, quiet room with all the comforts of home. (Our traveling companions in a nearby room, though, did have a noisy a/c unit.) And breakfast was great--lots of selections and plenty of food to go around. The staff were friendly and had everything we needed on hand, including printed directions to the rental car return center at Sky Harbor. The neighboring Hilton Garden Inn restaurant was fine too. we arrived late at phoenix, called the hotel from free telephones in the airport, the shuttle was there less than 10min after. Check in was easy, can enjoy the pool at evening, room with king size was comfortable and clean, bathroom too. Good night of sleep, the hotel was not full, and so very quiet. Good breakfast with eggs, sausages, toasts, muffins, pancakes, cereals, fruits, yoghurt... Check out was easy, one shuttle every 30min to go to the airport. The hotel shuttle dropped us to the airport, and we took another shuttle to go to the car rental area.\n",
      "Very good experience in this hotel, for 66$ (reservation one week in advance).\n",
      "Warning : The hotel is far from downtown, there seemed to be anything near so if you want to eat or go out, it can be a problem. I was in awe. This place was not your average Holiday Inn. Very nice staff. Clean, modern.\n",
      "A good example of service/staff would be I mentioned to the front desk I was going to return my rental car to the airport early so I wouldn't need to deal with it in the morning. She immediately pulled out directions from the hotel to the airport rental return, a number to call the shuttle, and instructions exactly where to wait for the shuttle depending on which terminal you were in. Impressive. Stress free! The shuttle is free the airport.\n",
      "The room had a fridge, huge TV, internet...great and safe place to stay. My family and I stayed here when flying into Phoenix for a trip to the Grand Canyon. Their shuttle service to the airport was excellent, and prompt, with no delays & nice driver. The breakfast was ok, since I'm not a fan of most hotel breakfasts since the food quality isn't the greatest, but they did have a very cool pancake making machine, that you press a button and in less than a minute, a pancake comes out the right side. I've never seen that before, and that was cool! We stayed one night at either end of our trip to Arizona and beyond. The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was fine, and all the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful.\n",
      "We didn't get a chance to use the swimming pool, but it looked nice.\n",
      "On our return leg we ate a very decent meal at the HIE's sister property ( Holiday Garden Inn) restaurant despite arriving only 5 minutes before their closing time. This was much appreciated after a long drive from LA.\n",
      "The hotel has a very convenient shuttle to and from the airport. We had just the loveliest chatty driver when we first arrived and were thrilled to see him again when we left Arizona. I'm afraid I failed to note his name,sorry, but if he's reading this, thank you once again for your welcome and good humour from the French family with the two girls! Very nice HIE. Internet worked very well and the room was up to date and clean. Shower and bathroom were fine. Nice outdoor pool in the rear of the property. Very reasonably priced on weekends I guess. From the outside the place looks well maintained and the AC worked as best as could be expected during this record heat wave. The hotel is located close to the airport and they have a complimentary shuttle. The check-in was super quick and the hotel is on the same property as the Hilton next door. The room had good size queen beds and the breakfast was really good. We use this hotel each month whether for a business trip or vacation. This hotel is very convenient to the airport (five min. drive) and their shuttle is ontime. We stay one night and park for up to two weeks for free. The hotel is fairly new, clean and quiet except for the ignorant people who let their doors slam. (You know who you are!) The hotel offers a varied dinner menu and also a breakfast in the morning which we don't usually have due to very early flights.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel. We had flown in from Burbank and were due to fly out on an early flight to Dallas, then on to Frankfurt. We easily caught a Shuttle Bus to the Hotel and the lady at check in was extremely nice and helpful. We told her we would like a wake up call and an early shuttle bus and she did it so easily. Our room was nice, warm but when the air con came on it was lovely. As we were tired we decided to have room service, I had the Curry Salad and it was DELICIOUS!! The room service was quick and the food was tasty. I had an enjoyable nights stay, and if I am ever in Phoenix again I will defo stay at this hotel. :-) We spent the night at Holiday Inn Express in order to be able to leave on an early flight the next morning. Rooms were very clean and well-equipped, and we enjoyed the hot breakfast. I also enjoyed the free shuttle to the airport. All of this for a reasonable rate! We needed a hotel for one night to make a connection to the airport.\n",
      "Due to the fact our plane was leaving early (very) we choose the hotel, it had free airport transport, and was nearby.\n",
      "It was a more expensive (almost double) than the one we had stayed on our way in (Holiday Inn Express in Scottsdale) but I thought it was worth it.\n",
      "I was wrong.\n",
      "The hotel was ok, but given the chance I would stay in Scottsdale and pay the taxi myself. \n",
      "The room was supposed to be a suite but it was so small! I was travelling with my husband and kids and there was really no space for all of us. Only because it was one short night I write ok, but to be honest it was not really big enough for 5 people. (And of course I did the reservation for 5). I think they did offer a rollabed, that I have no idea where it would have fit, but oh well. The staff was indeed very friendly, the hotel was fine, just the room was too small for 5, not a suite. Our trip lead us to need a one night stay in Phoenix, after flying in late at night. I choose this hotel based on the location to the airport and the other feedback. I was happy with this choice. The location was very easy to get to from the airport, as well as being very close. The room was very clean and simple. My family really enjoyed the breakfast. Basic food (muffins, cereal, bagels, fruit, pancakes,etc) and coffee, milk and juice. The hit of the food were the cinnamon rolls and the pancake maker (made individual servings); both of which were delicious. The breakfast and cleaning staff were polite and professional. The only down side was the front desk personnel. The person working in the evening (and was there in the early am on 7/14) does not appear to like his job. He was abrupt and not friendly at all. He went through his \"script\" and practically tossed us the room key card. In the morning there was no one at the desk for checkout (at ~8am) and myself and two other customers waited approximately 10 mins for someone to return to the desk. \n",
      "Overall, I would definitely come back to this location if needed a hotel close to this airport. Great location for travelers, good included breakfast and decent price. My husband and I stayed here twice in the last two weeks for one-night layovers on our way to and from Honolulu to a midwest destination. The rooms are bright and comfortable and the location is in a professionally maintained business area. However, on the 3 occasions (we came in on different flights the first time) we called to ask for airport transportation, there were miscommunications among the front desk, the van driver and one or both of us. The latest resulted in our standing out in the Arizona heat waiting for a van whose driver quit for the day unbeknownst to the desk. It wasn't until we called again that we found out that the current driver didn't know about our being there. This is just one of several times when the right hand didn't know what the left was doing. So keep on the front desk if your van isn't there quickly! \n",
      "One other drawback is that there is only a Waffle House and the small restaurant/bar with intrusive television in an adjacent hotel for meals. Nothing else within miles. We stayed for one night after landing in Phoenix. It was convenient for the airport. The taxi from the airport was $16 which a minimum fee. If you can find the airport shuttle as it's essentially free. The room was comfortable but we had to sort out the sofa bed for the kids. It was made up but just needed pulling out. A meal at the restaurant next door was good. It is inside the Hilton Hotel which fooled us for a while! Breakfast at the hotel was also good with plenty of choice. Overall it was a good stopover on our trip around Arizona. Stayed one night while awaiting flight the next day out of Sky Harbor. Staff were friendly. Room was clean. Overall appearance of hotel was acceptable. Beds were comfortable. Water pressure for shower was super! Plenty of places to eat nearby either walking or driving. Would/Will definitely stay here again without hesitation. Can't comment on the food as we left too early in the morning to eat.....lol. When we checked into our one, first floor room with two beds, the carpet was soaking wet throughout the room. The young lady at the desk agreed to change us to two separate rooms also on the first floor, but they had the same problem. She moved us to the second floor, two rooms with king beds at no additional charge. A bit of a delay as we had to keep moving our luggage, but she did the right thing. The rest of the stay was great with a late checkout until 2PM which was very helpful. Eat & drink @ allied Hilton Garden Hotel next door & put it on your hotel bill ! - lots of bar company I stayed one night at this hotel prior to an early morning flight out of Sky Harbor Airport. I chose this hotel because of the reasonable price ($89) and the ability to leave my vehicle there for up to two weeks while traveling. The room was nicely furnished, the blackout drapes did their job, the bed was comfortable and it was exactly what I expected from a Holiday Inn Express. Next door is a Hilton Garden Inn that, according to the desk clerk, is owned by the same person who owns the Holiday Inn Express. The Hilton has a full-service restaurant open for lunch and dinner and Holiday Inn guests can charge their meals to their room. This was a great convenience since the only restaurant close by is a Waffle House directly in front of the hotel. I had a salmon dinner that was excellent. My flight the next morning left too early for me to have breafast at the Holiday Inn Express, so I can't comment on the breakfast. I utilized the Holiday Inn Express shuttle service, which begins at 4:00 a.m. I had a last minute lay over in AZ. and need a room quick and close to the airport. I opened my laptop and searched Holetls near the Phoenix airport and found the Holiday in to have a reasonable price and asfree shutttle to and from the hote. I booked it last minute and was supprise to see what a great hotel it was. The breakfast in the morning was a great start for my flight into Los Angeles.\n",
      "Thanks A Million. We needed a room in Phoenix because we were flying out in the morning. The room was spotless and inviting. And quiet- a plus when you're staying near an airport! We weren't travelling with a laptop so the courtesy computer in the lobby allowed us to check-in with our airline the night before. A free breakfast in the morning is always a bonus when you're not sure when you'll next grab a bite to eat. Being celiac, I always have questions that need answering before I can eat what's offered and the woman responsible for the food prep was genuinely helpful and unperturbed by my questions. This will be our go-to hotel whenever we fly out of Phoenix. I loved staying at this hotel. It was very clean, the staff was friendly and the service was more then what I expected from a hotel at this price range. The one thing I would warn you about is the restaurant recommendation list. We went to the restaurant at the top of the list (Casey Moore's Ouster House) and it was, well, less than classy, a little smelly and just a typical college bar/restaurant/hangout joint. May I suggest the following local Phoenix restaurants for your stay : La Grande Orange (great pizza, wings and red velvet cake), That's a Wrap (fresh wraps), and Lola's Cafe (local coffee roaster that does latte art). Other than that picky little thing, the hotel staff was extremely helpful and I would gladly stay here again. I stayed here on 5/31/2011 in room 428; paying $100.81 total. Booked the hotel based on TA reviews and the need for a shuttle to Phoenix SkyHarbor the next morning. I travel about once a month for pleasure; this was my last night after a three week trip. Having read the other TA reviews I was aware that the only restaurant close by was a Waffle House so I had dinner down off University prior to checking in, (numerous restaurants can be found around ASU). I was traveling alone and felt very safe in this location and in this hotel. Very pleased with the room, the hotel, and the staff I came in contact with during my stay. I was flying out the next afternoon and, as a Priority Club Member, was offered a late checkout. It wasn't needed but was appreciated. Checked in around 8 p.m. - checkin was quick and my request for a room on the highest floor away from the elevator was met. \n",
      "Room was very clean (including curtains, window, behind doors, etc.), everything was in very good order, didn't use the fridge or microwave but they were available, large flat screen TV, appreciated the toiletries and better than average towels in the room, above average hotel breakfast with a very courteous staff member keeping the area neat/clean/stocked, comfortable bed, and quiet room. Did not use the pool but, upon inspection, saw it was very clean and all seemed to be in good repair. Towels were set out for the guests to use on each chair; found myself wishing I had brought my bathing suit. :-)\n",
      "I had been traveling three weeks at this time, had stayed in seven different hotels (3 being HIE), and had one of the best nights sleep I had in over three weeks. I often post pictures of the rooms I stay in but my room honestly looked like the pictures on the website. I always wipe down any handles, switches, remote, phone, etc.of any hotels I stay in - all were clean. Checked the bed - all the linens/mattress were in good shape and were clean. Took the free shuttle to the airport; very courteous driver and very prompt service. My only *wish* was the opportunity to purchase a secured wifi network (i.e. AirLock, etc.). I would highly recommend this hotel. If in the area again, I will be staying at this Holiday Inn Express. This was a nice, comfortable hotel. Room was clean and free morning breakfast was suitable. Pool was small but clean. We especially enjoyed the bargain of having our car parked there for free up to two weeks while we went on vacation. Shuttle service to Phoenix International Airport was a short 10 minutes from hotel and drivers were impeccablely on time. Great experience and we'll use this hotel again. Check-in was quick and efficient; staff was helpful and friendly; property clean and modern. Free breakfast was worth taking the time to enjoy. Free shuttle service to the airport was timely and courteous.\n",
      "The flat-screen TV got the better of us though, as the remote wouldn't turn it on and there weren't any buttons visible to operate it manually. New batteries for the remote didn't work either. The man who checked us in came with extra remotes (none of which worked), but together we found the touch buttons to turn the TV on manually. Problem was resolved the next morning when a maintenance person came, unhooked and reattached a cable on the back of the TV. We asked for and got a reduction for the inconvenience. Great standard hotel with everything needed! Spent two nights here and found a most of the staff kind and knowledgeable. Only one staff member seemed distracted when talking to us. It is located near Mill Ave. which has tons of places to eat. But be warned; it is a college town! Overall, however, it was just what our family needed. This is an excellent hotel, located close to the airport, but without the noise factor. Adjoins a Hilton with full restaurant. Even had a cocktail party for guests; limited selection, but free. I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while I was in Phoenix for my dad's birthday and it was one of the best hotels I've been too. I arrived at the Phoenix airport and called the hotel for their shuttle service. The front desk agent asked for my name and directed me to the pickup location. The driver came within 5 minutes and took us straight to the hotel. The drive to the hotel was very short. Upon arrival the front desk agent had our paperwork and room keys ready so check-in was brief.\n",
      "When we got into our rooms, the lights and A/C were turned on for us ahead of time. It was about 80 degrees at 11pm! But our room was very comfortable. It wasn't freezing or too warm. The rooms were beautiful and everything brand new. The bed was amazing! I wish I could have one at home. I had the best sleep of my life! The rooms were large and it had a 32\" LCD TV.\n",
      "The breakfast in the mornings were also great. Lots of items hot and cold items. They also rotate the hot meats daily which was nice. They have a really cool pancake machine. You just enter the number of pancakes you want and they come out in a couple minutes. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and helpful. One of my family member arrived late for breakfast but the attendant asked what they wanted and she heated up some eggs and sausage for them.\n",
      "They also offer room services and the prices were incredibly reasonable for hotel room service. It was the same as eating out at a restaurant. Which was very surprising. The late night snacks we ordered were very delicious.\n",
      "I highly recommend this hotel if you plan on staying in the Phoenix area. The staff was very friendly and hepful. I had an excellent vacation at this Holiday Inn. Everything was perfect, the morning breakfast and the entertainment facilities. I would highly recommend staying here, probably one of the best experiences I had. \n",
      "www.uopaxiasolutions.com We stayed here last year on our trip to Arizona. It is very convenient to the airport and car rental return. They have a good breakfast with those yummy cinnamon rolls!\n",
      "We enjoyed the Happy Hour, but the snacks were lackluster. Minimal chips with a jar of salsa and self made tuna fish sandwiches, blech!\n",
      "Close enough to Papago park for one last walk in the desert before leaving for the cold harsh world of the Pacific NW! This is a great hotel for travelers flying in and out of Phoenix as well as excellent access to the rental car area. My brother, sister and I stay 2 nights at this hotel (arrival and departure from Phoenix.) The staff are very accommodating, courteous and very helpful. The rooms are spacious and very clean and the hotel has many amenities available including a complimentary breakfast. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend this to anyone traveling in and out of Phoenix. Thanks again for making our stay so pleasant. This newly renovated Holiday Inn Express was a pleasant surprise find. Very clean and comfortable rooms, friendly helpful service, and a wonderful breakfast which was included in the stay. This hotel was close to the airport but don't let that discourage you as I never heard a single plane buzzing overhead. The staff was great and actually let us check in early without difficulty. Only one elevator to serve all floors though. The room was quite spacious for a family. We enjoyed having the mini fridge and microwave in the room, great for leftovers from restaurants. Oh and don't forget the full breakfast in the morning. The pool area was clean and stocked with clean towels. I plan on staying there again. After staying at this hotel, I will never use Orbitz again, and will try to always avoid Holiday Inn Express.\n",
      "Simply, I screwed up, but neither the hotel nor Orbitz would work with me to resolve my problem. When booking the hotel, I mistakenly picked the Airport location instead of the Downtown Holiday Inn Express, which was the one I wanted. I think part of the problem was that during booking, the prices of the rooms kept changing, so somehow I accidentally changed hotels. When I showed up at the wrong hotel and figured out my mistake, I tried to transfer the booking. The hotel told me I had to go through Orbitz. Orbitz told me I had to go through the hotel. No one would take responsibility, and no one would help me. I am convinced I would have had better luck if I booked directly with the hotel.\n",
      "Don't stay at this hotel and don't use Orbitz! This is a great hotel for travelers flying out of Phoenix. The rooms were spacious, clean, and had every ammenity possible. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. This hotel is very close to the airport and rental car return area. Highly recommend! My wife and I stayed here after the completion of our western trip. We drove down from Sedona and arrived well before the check in time. We were cheerfully given an early check-in. There was an issue with the tv. A person was at our door almost immediately to fix the problem. Although the hotel does not have a restaurant we were directed to the Hilton Garden Inn next door which does. We had a nice lunch. We were told that the same owner owns both hotels. They had Fat Tire Amber Ale on draught. Boy, that really hit the spot. The Garden Inn looks like a winner also. Back to the Holiday Inn Express. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom large. Shower had one of those great shower heads that you can now find at most Holiday Inn Expresses. Towels were very large and plush. If you are returning a rental car make sure you get the directions from the front desk, or you may find yourself driving in circles. The breakfast was good as was the outdoor pool and hot tub. Service was done with a smile. I have no complaints whatsoever. Holiday Inn Express is quickly becoming my hotel of choice. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night in September after a long haul flight. We wanted somewhere comfortable, that was near the airport so we could pick up the hire car easily the next morning. The holiday inn fitted the bill perfectly, the price is very reasonable considering the size of the rooms and the hotel staff are happy to arrange free shuttle transfers to and from the airport or car hire depot. Our room was a king suite, was very clean and had a huge, extremely comfortable bed. We weren't very hungry so the waffle house next door to the hotel was sufficient for us, apparently there is a restaurant in the hotel next door for more substantial meals. The complimentary breakfast is very nice and has a wide selection of breads, pastries and cereals, as well as eggs and bacon. Check-in was fast and efficient and the staff were helpful and friendly. There is a PC in the foyer which guests can use to access the internet. If you're looking for a hotel near the airport before or after a flight then I highly recommend the Holiday Inn. My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express the last day of our trip home to Massachusetts, I wish we had stayed longer. The staff at the front desk was very accomodating getting us our room earlier than check in time. Also, front desk was helpful to us with info about bringing our car back to airport, (which by the way was the worst part of our vacation.) The evening gathering in the lobby had 2 free drinks per guest which was a nice touch.I also took advantage of the laundry area to do vacation laundry. The rooms were large and very clean. The free shuttle to the airport the next morning was right on time and accomodating. I think the staff at this hotel gets a high 5 for service. My son and I needed a clean, comfortable hotel near Sky Harbor. I got lucky by choosing this Hoilday Express.\n",
      "Iwas told it was recently remodeled. It looked and felt that way. Cost was about $120.00 total.\n",
      "Beds were very comfortable. Clean. Quiet. My son made the comment on how the room seemed to maintain a constant temperature. It was 115 degrees outside.\n",
      "The breakfast was unbelievable. Eggs, bacon, fruit, rolls, yogurt etc. It was better than a purchased breakfast.\n",
      "I can't say enough good about this property. I think it was like 3 to 5 minutes from the airport too. A great hotel and well located to investigate Phoenix. Even though it was full of young people the hotel was quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful and when we checked in the poor check in girl had phones ringing and a long queue to deal with but she kept calm and friendly throughout. The room had two beds and was clean with a great air conditioning given the outside heat. Breakfast was a buffet and it was included in the price. There was internet access, with a printer, freely available in the foyer area. We were very nicely surprised with this hotel. It was supposed just to be a decent hotel near the airport before taking the 7 am flight. Turned out to be very accomodating, with friendly stuff, good and inexpensive restaurant at the Hilton next door, with spacious rooms with kettle, coffee and tea. Unfortunately we did not stay long enough to try the breakfast or use the pool. Free wi-fi and free use of a computer with internet in the lobby.\n",
      "The shuttle service to the airport was very helpful (the first one left at 4am).\n",
      "Overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel for a convenient stay nearby Phoenix airport. We stayed at this hotel for one night while passing thru Phoenix last weekend. We got to the hotel about 2 hours early and decided to see if we could check in early. The staff said it was no problem and checked us quickly in. Hotel was clean and room was nice and cool on a 100 degree day. The hotel seemed to be in a nice safe location. Looked like a business area but there was a Waffle House right next door. Very quick access to the interstate as well. Very nice hotel, would stay at again if going to Phoenix. Being in the hospitality business, you see a lot. There are some things that are not within a hotel's control, such as a city's temporary shut-off of water, etc. Service, however is paramount, and as a supervisor of mine always puts it, \"A room is a room, is a room. Guests want great service.\" \n",
      "At check in for a weekend we weren't really greeted but checked into our room. We made it to the happy hour and requested a gin and tonic, but they were out of tonic water. A vodka and orange juice? No orange juice. My friend joked,\"OK what can we have?\" The response was,\"Well you're a little late for cocktail hour, so you're lucky you're getting anything.\" I looked at his face for some sign of jest, but he was serious.\n",
      "The next night after requesting a ride on their complementary shuttle for a night out on the town, we were turned down because it was considered outside of their service zone. The clerk at the desk scoffed while letting us know, but called a cab for us. \n",
      "Rooms here are comfortable, and reflect an updated Holiday Inn look. Beds are very comfy. \n",
      "Being so close to the airport, this establishment is probably very used to accomodating business travelers and older patrons. Maybe the service we received was due to our age (late 20s). Nonetheless, I was not impressed, but I am glad that others have had positive experiences here. I won't be going back. we stayed here at the beginning and end of our easter holiday\n",
      "we arrived late on saturday night (15th) and the hotel was pretty full\n",
      "we were given a king room but we needed more room as we had our teenage son with us - they changed the room for one with a bed settee\n",
      "this made the room small but it was adequate\n",
      "the breakfast was fine - apples, oranges and bananas for fresh fruit....\n",
      "coffee and drinks available in reception all day\n",
      "we had a one night stay before flying to phillie and this time secured a room with two beds\n",
      "the rooms are clean and comfortable with toiletries supplied\n",
      "a nice touch is the option to acquire complimentary toothbrushes etc if you have forgotten yours\n",
      "we did not use the pool but it looked quite a small area\n",
      "we did use the computer in the reception are to print boarding passes and to find directions\n",
      "the staff were pleasant - especially the reception staff\n",
      "we paid $49 per night and considered this to be an absolute bargain (3 travellers)\n",
      "we would be happy to stay here again\n",
      "the shuttle drivers were friendly and helpful\n",
      "no complaints We stayed in this hotel after a long flight from Philadelphia - it was just what we needed. The price was reasonable. We arrived late at night and found the hotel easily from the airport. The hotel was clean. The room was comfortable and large enough for our family of 5. The hotel was quiet and the staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast was fine. No complaints. We have recently returned from a trip to Arizona which started and ended at the Holiday Inn Express at Phoenix Airport. During the week we stayed at two other higher priced hotels in Scottsdale and in Sedona but we found the value and attention to detail at the Phoenix Holiday Inn Express. Every staff member that we met were wonderful--from the front desk to the person picking us up and dropping us off at the airport. The breakfast was more than adequate and an especially nice touch was a happy hour at the end of the day. The rooms were very large with comfortable beds--very clean! We were travelling with our teenage son and found the space to be larger than most. Each room is equipped with a refrigerator. In this day and age when airline travel can be frustrating, these folks made our stay near the airport stress free. They actually shuttled us to the airport the night before to return our rental car and then again the next day. Everyone was very accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel for value, comfort, location and service. We stayed here one night before an early morning flight out of Phoenix. The room was large and very clean, and the bed was very comfortable with a choice of soft or firm pillows labelled for us to choose. We had 2 drinks compliments of the hotel, and a wonderful breakfast. We had a great sleep, no noise from other rooms, and the window opened so we enjoyed some fresh air. \n",
      "We would be happy to return here anytime! We stayed 5 nights at this property and have to say that it is an average, what you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. The breakfast was decent but you won't find much fresh fruit other than an apple. At EXACTLY 9:30 a.m. the staff immediately closed down the breakfast bar and anyone coming a minute late was pretty much out of luck. Most places are a little more casual, expecially on the weekends but not here. \n",
      "The free hosted bar is open from 6-7:30 pm M-F but we weren't able to make it to any of the nights as we were out eating dinner. It would seem like a slightly earlier opening time might be more customer friendly.\n",
      "The front desk staff was generally helpful and there is internet access from their computer in the lobby.\n",
      "The pool and spa area are small. Fortunately, both were kept very warm which was nice as the weather was somewhat cool. We had to ask for towels every day we used the spa/pool which could easily be solved by having an area at the pool stocked with towels. If your looking for a decent pool scene, this is not the place as it is way too small an area.\n",
      "Maid service was good and the room was kept clean and well supplied. Having a microwave and fridge really helped.\n",
      "This hotel is not near any restaurants/supermarkets and a car is a must in this area. It is convienient however to get on the freeway and go where ever you need to go.\n",
      "I would probably consider staying here again but would not pay $180 a night under any circumstances. We were given a free upgrade to a king suite upon arrival.\n",
      "The suite was larger than many apartments I've been in. The king bed was extremely comfortable. The room was very quiet. \n",
      "Everything that we tried worked. The internet was very fast. We didn't have a chance to try the jacuzzi in the tub.\n",
      "We also didn't have time for the continental breakfast, so I can't comment on that. The vending machine on our floor had more choices for water (and they were all the same!) than for soft drinks.\n",
      "The shuttle ran every half hour to the airport. I would have preferred every 15 minutes, but I have no idea what the standard is.\n",
      "We'd definitely stay there again. I stayed at this property after booking through Hotwire. The check-in went smoothly and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room I was assigned was clean and quiet and was a comfortable space to be in. I especially appreciated the very comfortable king bed. I would happily stay here again.\n",
      "The location was ideal for access by car to both the Phoenix airport and to Arizona State University in Tempe. Stayed 1 night had been up 20 hours staff exremely friendly and helpful room clean and more than adequate We were just looking for a place to sleep after a long transatlantic flight, and while this hotel didn't distinguish itself from many others, it was fine. The bed was really comfortable, it was quick and easy to find from the airport and had good access for driving out of Phoenix the next day. Breakfast was good too.\n",
      "Only issue, if it's a concern for you, is there's no restaurant or bar. But there's a waffle house in the car park, and a bar/restaurant at the hotel next door (I think they deliver to your room too). So it's not really a problem! \n",
      "Would stay again, as a place to rest my weary head! We booked this hotel on the basis of the reviews on this site - thanks guys, we had an excellent stay. We had a long journey, due to being delayed at Heathrow and the inevitable long time it takes to get through security, getting to the car hire centre and getting to the hotel. But this hotel was a little oasis. \n",
      "We needed a snack and they sold pots of instant noodles in their shop which did the trick. Our room was spotless and had everything we needed for a quick stop-over before we began our road trip the next day. \n",
      "Continental breakfast was exactly as described and set us up for the day. The chap on reception was really helpful with all the questions I asked of him, including directions so we could onto the intersate the next day.\n",
      "There was a computer connected to the internet in the reception which guests can use for free which is a big help if you need to do a bit of research before you travel.\n",
      "I think I had the best night's sleep here during the whole trip, apart from another Holiday Inn Express (in Benson AZ)! Stayed at this hotel for one night having flown in from New York and before heading north to Flagstaff. Had booked two twin bedded rooms next to each other for myself, my husband and 2 kids. Having checked trip advisor reviews, I expected clean but basic rooms - however I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms each had two queen sized beds and were spotlessly clean. The beds were some of the most comfortable we had ever slept in . The air conditioning worked well and was not too noisy. The bathroom was also spotless and had a good choice of complimentary shampoos etc. The only slight disappointment was the continental breakfast, which offered very little choice. However for $93 a night, I reckoned it was reasonable value overall and would use it again. I've stayed here a couple of times the night before flying home from Phoenix. For that purpose, it is a great hotel. Quiet, comfortable, clean, and friendly staff. Good location for flying out the next morning. No negatives to report. We stayed two nights here - on arriving in Phoenix and then again the night before flying home. The rooms were large and well-equipped. On the last night, our room had a tv with a green tinge. Since it was a Saturday, there wasn't a maintenance person available so they moved us to another room right down the hall. When my husband went down to get the keys, Nicole had already written an apology note and included coupons for goodies from the Pantry. Nice touch! We found this hotel easily accessible from the airport and convenient to the museums that we visited while in Phoenix. My husband and I stayed at this HIE the night prior to flying home after a ten day tour of northern New Mexico and Arizona.\n",
      "I was very pleasantly surprised by the level of service at an airport hotel, especially a happy hour with free drinks.\n",
      "The room was nicely renovated and clean, with all the amenities.\n",
      "I noticed that there was shuttle service to the airport which we did not use because we had a rental car. This property is very convenient to the airport, as well as to downtown Phoenix for dinner and/or a ball game. I recently drive into Phoenix from Sedona and needed a place to stay with shuttle service to the airport. This is the best place!!! The shuttle came within 15 min. of my call and our driver was very pleasant. I requested a room on the first floor since I was traveling with my mother. The staff was very helpful and accommodated us immediately. Everything was as expected at a HI Express....especially the cinnamon rolls the next morning. Our shuttle bus was right on time at 6 am the next morning and took us to our terminal on time. This is the place to stay if you need to have a hotel near the airport with shuttle service. We had a very early flight, so this hotel was a great choice for quick access to the car rental return at the airport. The desk clerk was not friendly at check-in, but we were pleased with everything else about the hotel. The room was very nice and clean. We had a small refrigerator and microwave. There is only one pancake restaurant nearby, so we had to drive a little ways to find a restaurant for dinner. Since we had such an early flight, we weren't able to enjoy the complimentary breakfast. I noticed a computer with Internet access and a printer in the lobby. Checkout was unnecessary since the statement was placed under our door during the night. If we need to stay near the Phoenix airport again, we will be happy to stay here. I really thought this hotel was nice. The bed was super comfy with lots of pillows to choose from. The room was very clean and the shower was great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I ever visit the area. We stayed here after a week of travelling in Sedona and the Grand Canyon. It was by far the best nights sleep I had all week. Beds/pillows/towels were so comfortable. The hotel was nice, very quite, staff was helpful, it was clean and the shuttle to the airport was on time and perfect. Stayed there for 2 weeks while on business. This hotel was remodeled in 2007 but you'd think it was newer. The rooms are good size, kept very clean, beds comfortable. Bathrooms are great, water pressure better than home. Microwave/fridge is very helpful when staying longer than a night or two. Restaurant next door at the Hilton or you can get delivery from local spots. Free breakfast is fresh and quite good (eggs, bacon and/or sausage, \"famous\" cinnamon buns, toast,bagels, etc). It was a real pleasure! Staff is very accomodating ande helpful. Fitness center was a nice surprise. Used as a first night stop over. Prompt collection following a call made using the courtesy airport phone. The shuttle took us back to the airport the next day to collect the hire car. Friendly helpful staff and clean rooms. Good choice for breakfast which was included. Stayed here one night last week the night before I was flying out of town. Great location. They have a computer available for you to check in and print your boarding passes. Just what I needed. As an airport hotel, good value,helpful staff and an adequate room. Arrived late and left early but ideal for a one night stay. we live in Vail, AZ and had an early morning flight out of PHX. we decided to go up and spend the night instead of dealing with I-10 and rushing to the airport. This hotel is the perfect place to stay for a night before your trip! We had the happy hour and grabbed a couple of things from the breakfast bar before the shuttle came. We had a room with two queens and it was plenty big enough for our family of 4.\n",
      "the only suggestion I would make is to be sure to allow plenty of time on the shuttle. We took the 6 am shuttle for our 7:50 flight. The shuttle was running a bit behind and we got to the airport at 6:20. I am glad we decided to give ourselves some extra time. Also when we got in, got our luggage and called the hotel we had to wait about 20 mins for a shuttle to take us back to the hotel and retrieve our car. Situated in a new industrial park with other upscale chain hotels, Holiday Inn will not disappoint you with respect to cleanliness, fresh linens, comfy beds, lots of pillows, ambience, selection of toiletries, and in-room conveniences like coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. The outdoor pool area includes a hot pool and patio chairs/tables which we used while enjoying our morning coffee in the sunshine. Breakfast is self-serve with a variety of choices ranging from make-you-own waffles, cold/hot cereals, and breads/pastries. This hotel did not have a computer station in the lobby. For an evening meal in the area, you'll have to rely on restaurants located in other hotels beside this property like those in the Hilton and Radisson hotels or the Waffle restaurant next door. The front desk provides written directions to the car rental return terminal. Combining these directions with the map in our AAA book, we had no trouble finding our way there. The car return is at the far end of the airport so you'll have to hop on a terminal bus which will take you to your airport terminal free of charge. It's hassle free --no long waits. We didn't make use of this hotel's free airport shuttle. I'd use this hotel again. We were just staying overnight to catch a flight the next morning. The rooms were clean and spacious and the hotel seems quite new. We had dinner and drinks next door at the Hilton, which was good. We then swam. The pool was sufficient, maybe a tad over chlorinated, but all in all, in good shape. The free shuttle to the airport was a very nice feature, but the driver was a tad crazy, especially when you have two toddlers sitting in your lap. As with most of the Holiday Inn Expresses I have stayed at, it was a agreat place. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for a family reunion. I worked, from California, with Jim Penberthy. There was nothing we asked for that was not accomodated; requests were filled very quickly. The service was over and above expectations. The staff was friendly and concerned with our comfort. Not one of the 50 people in our group had a complaint regarding the facilities. They raved about the value of meals and rooms. We were there for two days, we felt very at home and comfortable. The facility was very clean, the complimentary breakfast was fresh, hot, and tasty. The meeting facility was perfect for our initial meeting. Jim did an excellent job of making sure everything was well coordinated by the time I arrived. Our early guests were well accomodated with their pre-printed agenda's. We had two catered meals at the adjoining conference center. The service and meals there would compare and surpass other hotels were I have attended business events. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, for any function. We stayed at this Holiday Inn one Friday night in July 2006. It was easy to find and conveniently located to I-10 and the PHX airport. It was in a safe area full of businesses and other hotels however (besides a Waffle House) there is not much to eat within walking distance. But a quick ride up the street or on the interstate and that problem is resolved. \n",
      "Our top floor room was nice and clean with comfy beds and pillows. The bathroom was above average as it was clean, adequately-sized, and stocked with higher-end sample products. The A/C pumped a lot of cool air to offset the Phoenix heat outside. \n",
      "We didn't have our laptop and we didn't need to use the internet while we were there so we don't know what they provide onsite.\n",
      "The staff was very professional and kind. My wife dropped her full cup of coffee on the floor while they were setting up breakfast at 6:00 AM. The attendant on hand came over, cleaned things up, and did so with a smile. The breakfast was slightly above average for a continental given all of the choices - bagels, muffins, cereals, yogurt, bananas, choice of milk, brownies, etc. \n",
      "The biggest plus for this hotel is the park and fly program. We booked this room at a rate we were happy with and it included a roundtrip to the airport via the hotel's shuttle. This saves big bucks on parking of course as you can keep your car at the hotel in one of their (very tight) courtesy parking spots. Be nice and tip your driver - he can get you there within 10 minutes or so provided you are not flying during rush hour. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes from early AM to late PM. \n",
      "Our only complaint was that the hotel's complimentary happy hour couldn't be extended a little beyond 7:45 as we just missed out on a round of drinks. Oh well - can't have it all! \n",
      "Anyway, this hotel was a nice find and we will gladly stay there again in the future whenever we fly from PHX. We stayed here for one night on the way back from Flagstaff because we had a 7:00 am flight. The staff was very friendly and our room was great. The room had quiet a/c, it was clean, a big bathroom, great tv, and a micro and fridge. The pool was nice and the spa looked o.k., but way too hot to get in it. The reason we chose this hotel was the reviews and the shuttle service. We were able to turn our rental car in the afternoon before and the shuttle driver picked up my husband making it very convienent. The next morning the shuttle was there on time and took us right to the door. They had a complimentary happy hour which was nice. At the recommendation of the front staff, we ordered pizza from a place called \"Bostons\" and it arrived quickly and was very good. As one other reviewer stated, this is not the place to stay if you want to walk around at night, it's industrial. But if you want a place before flying out this is great. I expected something sleezy to be by the airport, but this hotel was gorgeous and had all the amenities I was looking for - especially the free airport shuttle. We had a very early flight in the morning, so I returned our rental car the night before. Took the shuttle back to the hotel and out again the next morning. Very easy!\n",
      "Our room was very roomy and included a fridge, microwave and coffee pot. The bathroom was beautiful and the pillows were so perfect that I want some just like them. Thanks to the inclusion of hardboiled eggs, the complimentary breakfast was quite nice. Otherwise, there isn't a restaurant in the building - just one next door at the HIlton (sister hotel) - so I'm glad I kept my car until after we had dinner. Seeking Asian fare, the hotel clerk directed us to P F Chang's China Bistro, about 4 miles away at E. University and S. Mill Ave. It was fabulous, and the surrounding ASU campus area was bustling with activity.\n",
      "The hotel clerk also said they'd be renovating the decor soon, but I thought it was just fine the way it was. I would definitely stay here again. Hotel decor tired and out dated. Not in a great location. Would not walk around at night or drive too far away from hotel- only plus is that convenient to the airport. Hotel was clean, but could use a make over. We booked this hotel because they offered a free shuttle service to and from the airport. Simply put, we found out that it was actually cheaper to book a room here then to leave our car in long term parking for the duration of our trip. Although we only stayed one night, we were very pleased with the hotel. The pool was a wonderful escape from the summer heat and the room was quiet and clean. We were gone for two weeks and spent a lot of time in other hotels but at the end this hotel was our favorite! Excellent value. Clean rooms, good decor, excellent friendly staff. Very convenient to airport. Free drinks in lobby. Great continental breakfast included in price. \n",
      "Highly recommend staying here. We started and ended our holiday at this Hotel, and we are so glad we did. We found the hotel to be very clean, in good decor and pleasantly laid out. The staff were very helpful and freindly. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would definately stay there again if we get the chance to return Phoenix. This was by far the best hotel that we stayed in during our week-long visit to Phoenix, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. Rooms were clean, the price was excellent and they even had free drinks in the lobby and snacks. Very convenient to the airport also. Pessimo! appena spenta la luce del bagno mi sono accorto che il forte rumore di ventole non era dovuto all'aspiratore del bagno ma continuava a persistere. Ho pensato che si sarebbe spento poco dopo. Nulla. Ho \"esplorato\" tutto l'ultimo piano in cui ero, sempre rumorosissimo. Sono sceso al terzo, il rumore era molto inferiore. Sono andato alla reception e non c'era nessuno. (Sara' stato dopo mezzanotte).\n",
      "Non c'era nessun campanello per chiamare un impiegato. Sono tornato a letto ed\n",
      "ho fatto mattina con i tappi nelle orecchie: la mia peggior notte negli USA (e ci sono stato piu\n",
      "volte, per centinaia di notti). Il quarto piano dovrebbero insonorizzarlo bene oppure non\n",
      "utilizzarlo. Non ci tornerei, a quel piano, il quarto, nemmeno se mi dessero la camera gratis. a 5 minuti dalla riconsegna auto dell'autonoleggio questa struttura nuova e ben tenuta ci ha ospitato per una notte. Camere pulite e spaziose, business center aperto e gratuito per poter navigare e stampare, buon segnale wifi gratuito nella stanza. Nach unserer Ankunft mitten in der Nach in Phoenix haben wir in diesem Hotel übernachtet. Es liegt nur 5 Min fahrt vom Airport und somit ideal wenn man spät landet. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig, die Betten sehr bequem, die Lage sehr ruhig, es hat sogar einen Pool welchen wir nicht ausprobiert haben. Hinter der Reception befindet sich eine Art Kiosk wo Kleinigkeiten auch mitten in der Nacht gekauft werden können. Dies ist für Late-Arrivals sehr praktisch! Zimmer war sauber, TV riesig - ein idealer Start für unsere Rundreise. Pour ceux qui arrivent ou partent de l'aéroport de Phoenix,cet hotel est parfait pour sa proximité(relative),son environnement agréable et calme,son confort et son accueil très professionnel.Le petit-déjeuner est varié.Un ordinateur est à disposition dans le lobby.On peut prendre un repas dans le Hilton voisin.La navette est ponctuelle.Bon rapport qualité-prix.Que des compliments! An- und Abreise mit dem kostenlosen shuttle (ca. 10 min) ebenso problemlos wie der check-in und -out. Ich hatte ein ruhiges und sauberes Zimmer; WLAN kostenlos; das Bett super bequem.\n",
      "Das Frühstück war sehr gut: außer dem für diese Hotellkette bekanten exzellenten Kaffee gab es auch Rührei mit Speck (appetitlich) und es wurde jeweils rasch nachgefüllt. Ett bra hotell med mycket bra frukost och transport till flyget med buss som gär varje halv timma den första kl 04.00 på morgonen.\n",
      "Mycket service för pengarna.\n",
      "Bra service från personalen.\n",
      "Långt från sevärdheter och nöjen.\n",
      "Ingen egen bar.\n",
      "Next door samarbete grann hotellet har fin bar och serverar midag öppet från pm.06.00 mat som du kan ta med in till ditt eget rum om du vill, och en bra sportbar.\n",
      "Tyvärr så viste vi inte det förän sista dagen det om next door samarbetet. Flyplasshotell 5-10 min. kjøring fra Phoenix Sky Harbour. Shuttleservice som fungerte bra begge veier. Helt OK standard og hyggelig og hjelpsom betjening. En enkel frokost er inkludert. Restaurant og bar i det samarbeidende nabohotellet (Hilton Gardens Inn, 100m). Gørr beliggenhet, kun egnet for overnatting i forbindelse med flyreise til eller fra Phoenix. Accueil et services très satisfaisants.\n",
      "Avons utilisé la navette avec l'aéroport pour rendre la voiture la veille de notre retour. La personne de l'accueil nous a très bien renseigné malgré notre anglais moyen. Navette très rapide et simple à utiliser. hotel come da aspettative e recensioni precedentemente lette molto bello pulito con tutte le comodità in camera molto vicino all'aeroporto , 6 km; circa in 10 minuti in auto site sul posto , trovate anche navetta dell'hotel, la colazione alla mattina è molto abbondante e trovate molta scelta. Nous sommes restés juste une nuit. La chambre est très propre et très grande. Le petit déjeuner est très varié, sucré ou salé selon les plaisirs. On peut manger dans la salle comme on peut emporter son petit déjeuner dans la chambre. En tout cas, très bon rapport qualité/prix. Wir waren sehr zufrieden, es gab genügend Platz und alles war sauber und ordentlich. Kann man bedenkenlos empfehlen.\n",
      "Frühstück haben wir nicht genutzt, war uns ZU früh... Una notte ho dormito bene, l'altra una settimana dopo, vicino alla stanza con i motori della ventilazione passando una notte insonne. Non ci hanno cambiato stanza.\n",
      "-- J'ai séjourné une nuit dans cette hotel en arrivant le soir à Phoenix après un vol transatlantique, autant dire que j'étais bien crevé ! L hotel se situe près de l'aéroport, facile à trouver quand on arrive et aucun désagrément dû aux avions. Il se situe dans un quartier calme et tout à fait sûr, mais sans commodités à proximité : les restaurants, boutiques etc ... sont à une dizaine de kilomètres sur S. Mill Avenue : il vaut mieux le savoir. Accueil très pro, aimable et efficace. Belle chambre très propre, lit très confortable. Petit déjeuner continental inclus, et excellent. Un poil cher, mais sinon à recommander. Nous avons séjourné à 4 dans cette hotel durant notre voyage dans l'Ouest des USA en juillet 2007. Acceuil agréable et sympathique. Bonne localisation (pas trop loin de l'aéroport d'ailleurs ).Chambre très spacieuse, hôtel moderne et très propre. En plus le petit déjeuner continental fut offert, ce qui ne semblait pas prévu dans notre réservation. La clim fonctionnait tres bien malgré la chaleur extérieure( pratiquement 38° C) , seul petit bémol s'il en faut un la taille de la piscine un petit peu petite. Nous y retournerons sans hésitation . Stayed there for 4 days \n",

      "EXcellent Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!! We wanted to get out of the snow of Flagstaff & just came down for the weekend. The Staff was soooo nice & friendly to my children & very informative. They played by the pool & had fun in the hot tub!! We will definitely be back for another get away. This is a great hotel for business travlers. I came to Phoenix for business and brought my wife and 3 year old with me. It is close and convient to the airport and the free shuttle was nice as well. This hotel is clean and neat and the bed was so comfortable that even my wife liked it. The staff was friendly and gave us good local information. Next month when I come back to Phoenix I will stay there again. And I would reccomend it to other travlers as well. I thought it was a great place until.....I woke up with bites on my legs and arms, pulled the sheets back and found BED BUGS! I talked to the front desk, they weren't surprised...GM didn't even talk to me. Clerk said, \"Sorry about that\" For $139 per night, I expected something better than 20-year-old WalMart particle board furniture. I also expected a flat screen TV and maybe even a DVD player. Nope... a smallish old TV. The room is the equivalent of a motel room costing half as much. Typical Holiday Inn Express experience. Booked online. Check-in VERY quick. Room was good size, fairly basic, but clean and tidy. Location is great if you are flying in and out quickly. Great stay. Stayed here after getting off a late night flight into Phoenix. Phoned the free hotel shuttle bus, it picked us and another couple up really quickly.\n",
      "Hotel is very nice and has everthing you need.\n",
      "Best bit for me was the bed it was huge and really comfy, slept like a baby.\n",
      "Breakfast in the morning was good and included sausage and eggs as well as all the normal stuff.\n",
      "The shuttle bus took us to the car hire place next morning whcih was ideal, shuttle driver was very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "Would use this hotel again for easy access to/from the airport. I had an early check in arranged with the hotel for the day I arrived on Dec. 5th. When I got to the hotel the girl at the desk was looking at the computer. I walked all the way up to the desk and literally stood there for 5 minutes while this girl looked at her computer screen. Finally she looked up and with no smile she said what can I do for you? I told her I was there to check in, she acted like I was asking a lot from her. She grunted and groaned and slowly proceeded to check me in. She barely talked to me like I was bothering her or something. I had to ask what time was breakfast, how the shuttles ran, and what time checkout was. I was practically doing her job for her. With all this aside I was still very polite to her and asked if she could recommend some attractions in the area, she then told me that theres a computer behind me and that I could google it. REALLY? You work at a hotel and you tell your guest to google it. I was so mortified by this whole check in process, I grabbed my room keys and gave the front desk clerk what she wanted. Which was to be left alone! I really wish I would have gotten the girls name and reported this to corporate. Better yet I should have returned the keys and found another hotel to stay at, but being tired I didnt. A little later on when I went to use the guest computer, I saw the same girl smiling and happy talking to a co-worker. SO I guess it is just the guests that she was unhappy with. This whole thing was a horrible way to end my vacation. Luckily, there was a gentlemen working in the afternoon. He was very helpful, polite, smiling and was really determined to make my stay wonderful. If it hadn't been for him, I would have taken my complaints further. All I have to say is that if you dont want to give customer service then do not work in a customer service industry. I hope other travelers read this and take this into consideration. If you are looking for customer service this might not be the place for you. Or atleast not with that lady. I looked for a hotel in Phoenix for a Thanksgiving weekend stay. We live in San Diego and my girlfriend wanted to visit her friend and we wanted to see Sedona and maybe the Grand Canyon. I chose this one from the great reviews in trip advisor. When I arrived in the afternoon, we checked in with a somewhat \"frowning\" young lady behind the counter. I asked about a recommendation for a Grand Canyon tour and she said they cater to \"business\" and no one ever asked her that question and didn't know. I then asked to borrow a pair of scissors since we had a new laptop case and needed to cut off the tag. She said she doesn't have any scissors because the guests keep stealing their scissors. I said \"OK, no problem\". I then decided to ask a gentleman the same question about the Grand Canyon in the morning and basically got the same answer. He was friendlier and did point in a direction to some brochures which I ended up using for a Grand Canyon trip on Saturday. \n",
      " On Friday, we spent the whole day in Sedona. When we got back we found the room was not cleaned and bed was not made. When I called the front desk, I was asked if we left do not disturb sign out. I said no and then got we are sorry apology and two orange juices. \n",
      " I think this hotel may be good for a quick business trip, but as they told me twice, they don't cater to leisure. We only stayed here for one night but I wish it had been for more. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was clean (but cold) and the hot tub was warm and inviting. We didn't have time to eat breakfast but it looked like a nice area to eat. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious! It was very quiet, too! This hotel was very convenient to the airport and the car rental area and they even had a shuttle! I would stay here again if I need a hotel near Sky Harbor Airport! \n",
      "There is not a restaraunt here but there is a Hilton Garden Inn next door with a pretty good restaraunt. There is also a Waffle House (which was pretty good) across the parking lot from the hotel. Very convenient on both counts! This is the second time we've come here for business and we would highly recommend this hotel. It is clean, updated, the staff is helpful and friendly, the breakfast is excellent and the service is consistently outstanding. The shuttle service includes free rides to area restaurants: they even had the manager pick us up from dinner last night so we wouldn't have to wait for the shuttle. \n",
      "Sandy, Vancouver BC The Holiday Inn Express was very close to the airport, super clean, and cost effective. While we \"sacrificed\" modern decor and a flat screen, we had a great stay. Staff were super friendly. The room was cozy, clean and comfortable-- no complaints. Free breakfast is also included-- it was pretty decent. \n",
      "Bottom line: You can't go wrong with Holiday Inn Express. Everything about this hotel clicked. Close to airport - check. Fast and free shuttle to airport - check. Large clean lobby - check. Nice front desk staff - check. Workout facility - check. Pool - check. Great and free breakfast - check. Clean and well-appointed room - check. Free internet - check. Comfortable bed - check. Sound proof rooms - check. I stayed two separate nights on either end of a trip to Sedona and it was great both times. An excellent find. We chose this hotel for its location, only 10 mins drive from Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and because it was very cheap! Our room was nice & clean room (fairly small but perfectly OK for a night). Check-in & check-out were both efficient and friendly. Breakfast was fine - fruit, patisserie, breads, cooked items - but coffee was awful & the juice very sickly & sweet. We left very early the next morning so didn’t try the pool but it looked fine. Recommended if you need somewhere to crash before / after a flight. This hotel was great for the money. Great service, attentive. Left our car for 10 days, shuttle to airport. Snacks and any drink you wanted on Wed. evenings. Everything about this hotel, especially their staff, was great. uncovered parking, but safe, with restaurant next door and right off freeway. I would stay here again. Breakfast was nice, ample. 6 Minutes from airport. Super clean. Paid $79. Great breakfast We stayed at this Holiday Inn twice during April, 2010, largely as a result of the Icelandic Volcano which would not allow us to fly home to the UK. We booked at very short notice (Priority Club) and the reception staff could not have been more helpful or sympathetic to our predicament. Rooms were quickly arranged for us, and we ate twice at the nearby and related Hilton Garden Suite. \n",
      "The shuttle service into Phoenix was very efficient, and we had only to dial a special number (45) from the airport in order to get picked up. The service was free, although we did choose to tip the drivers. \n",
      "The breakfast service was good, although the range of cooked food was limited. There was a happy hour each evening, with drinks. We did this twice, although on the first occasion we were served by a very surly youth who was actually only interested in watching the TV and sending text messages on his phone. \n",
      "A good stay, and very good staff. We recently stayed one night after flying in late. I had booked this because I trust the HI Express brand to be clean, comfortable and we like the complimentary breakfasts. It met all our expections. Was well maintained, nice modern hotel. Lovely lobby area. We used the free internet station in the lobby. The breakfast was good for a family - yogurts, fruit, cereals, cinnamon rolls, egg, sausage, biscuits, bagels, fruit juice. We didn't use the pool as we were leaving promptly the next morning, although the pool area looked nice with hot tub. We drove about 10-15 mins into Tempe where we had dinner at Chili's. There was an attached restaurant and nearby pancake/waffle restaurant but we chose to drive about 10 or 15 mins into Tempe to Chili's. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere with great amenities near the airport. we were in phoenix for a week and decided not to book into a hotel for all 7 nights cause you never know what you get . well after 3 nights in another hotel we decided to move into this holiday inn. what a difference the staff is very friendly and helpful. the housekeepers do a wonderful job keeping the room clean and fresh. the pool and hot tub is so clean and towels outside all the time. their breakfast is fresh and delicious. we cant say enough about this hotels. the price is great. we do alot of traveling with hotels and we will stay with this one the next time we go to phoenix. so thank you so much for such an enjoyable stay. Arrived late evening and telephoned the hotel shuttle and it was very quick. Check in was quick and the desk clerks very very curtious and greeted you with a smile. The room was very roomy and house keeping was excellent. The breakfast next morning was excellent and you had a very good variety to choose from. Unfortuneately we were only stayed for one night as we were touring around Arizona. Would definately return. We stayed here for two weeks, March 5-18 2011. The check-in was quick, rooms incredibly clean, wonderful hotel staff. Hotel was very quiet even though it was usually at/near capacity. Pool was usually clean, sometimes towels weren't picked up until the end of the day. Hot tub clean & HOT! \n",
      "The one improvement I would hope for is the beds. I love firm beds, but these are rock hard, and left me with a back ache for the duration of the trip. (I am a sucker for the Sheraton beds, myself.)\n",
      "Front desk staff was very accommodating due to unexpected need to fax things a few times, and pleasant, too. Overnight \"scooter girl\" (drove scooter to work) was awesome, as was the over night guy, I can't believe I forgot his name already. Hubby and I usually chatted in the evenings with him on our way in from smoking (hotel is entirely non-smoking, fine with me.)\n",
      "Breakfast is over PROMPTLY at 9:30, so if that's what you want, be there on time. \n",
      "One night the battery went dead on our door lock, we couldn't get in. They gave us a room across the hall for the time being, it took about an hour and a half to get it working again. It was late at night, and the manager even came in to make sure we could get back in. \n",
      "I would absolutely stay here again the very next time I am in phoenix. The only thing is the cost - not extravagant, but still up there. It was peak season, granted, although I thought it was about $20-30 higher than it should have been, with the W hotel charging the same price. Very comfortable hotel, good sized room, and good breakfast including hot food which is quite unusual in the US. Location is handy for a stop over after flying into the airport as it's only a 10 minute drive. I find that hotels are all about expectations. I often stay at a Holiday Inn Express if I know its going to be for a quick night or two. After their brand relaunch, you can pretty much expect the exact same thing at each property - which can be comforting. In this case, we wanted something close the airport - and with a free airport shuttle. And here is where my biggest complaint was - the shuttle was about 20 minutes late, which stressed me out a bit since I've never flown out of the phx airport and didn't know what to expect with increased security these days. I felt like the front desk should have communicated with the group of people waiting that the shuttle driver was running late. Luckily, when the shuttle came we were in the first group she dropped off. Also, phx airport security was incredibly smooth - the TSA employees were some of the nicest I've seen in the US and we didn't have wait too much at all. Anyways, the hotel room was exceptionally clean. The beds at Holiday Inn Express are great too - I can always count on a good night's rest at these hotels. The free breakfast is always adequate as well. This particular hotel had the new pancake machines - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very easy to use and the finished product was tasty. Didn't get to use the pool but it looked average, and it was outdoors. Their fitness center was also decent and I always love free high speed internet. Other than the issue with the shuttle, I would say its exactly what I would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. We stayed here in a King Suite for 1 night. The shuttle bus arrived very quickly at PHX. Check in was seamless, the young lady was very pleasant. The room was spacious and quiet and catered for what we needed after a long transatlantic flight. We mistakenly thought the sofa bed had not been made up, and the lady at the desk arranged new linen etc to rectify this. We found the bed had in fact been done when we unfolded it, but the extra blankets came in handy nonetheless. (we were too embarrassed and tired to go apologise...sorry!)\n",
      "Convenient breakfast as well. We did not use any other other facilities here. The young lady at the front desk, named Dulce, was above average with her helpfulness and was so very pleasant to deal with. She alone made the stay very pleasant. Rooms were quiet and the entire staff was very pleasant. Highly recommend this hotel. I stayed in this hotel during early November 2010. It was a base for a Arizona trip I took with my dad. It was a pretty good base! We did not spend much time in the hotel during the day as we drove throughout the state. \n",
      "It is not the type of hotel you would want to stay in without a rental car. It has no shops near by it. The airport van is free so you could always take that back and forth! \n",
      "The staff was pretty good. They helped us with directions and gave us some information about Arizona Mills Mall. A few of the front desk ladies were not as friendly as I would hope and took some phone calls over our questions. \n",
      "The room was great! It had a fridge and a microwave and we booked one of the smaller rooms! The beds are great...I love Holiday Inn beds! I just hate the pillows. The pillows were not good and I found it hard to get comfortable with them. \n",
      "The rooms were very clean and that is so important! The bathroom was nice and had a great shower. The rooms were cleaned daily and were usually spotless. \n",
      "I would stay here again. We decided to stay here due to an early flight the next morning. It is a new hotel and very clean. The beds were comfortable, although not pillow top. It is less than five minutes from the airport, yet noise was not an issue. We would choose to stay here again when flying out of Phoenix. We chose this hotel because of previous positive reviews. We found the it to be everything we expected. The decor of the building has a warm inviting feel, cleaniness, comfort and even the quality of the finishing work was very good and the friendliness of all employees encountered was excellent with a special mention for Dulce at the front desk. This hotel and the Hilton Garden Inn right next to it share shuttles and restaurant. The free shuttle was very convenient, taking us to the science museum and picking us up at a restaurant and we showed our appreciation in the tip. Keep up the good work. Excellent, new hotel with friendly service. I never thought I would be saying this about a Holiday Inn (I hadn't stayed in one for 20 years). Fantastic value for money. That is if you consider it a airport hotel. Staff is friendly, rooms are big enough and clean. Although the view is not the most attractve. The pool is a bit small but does the job in the Phoenix temperatures. Dining in the hotel was not possible, but a 2min walk to the Hilton next door gives you a nice restaurant and/or a Waffle House. Breakfast in the hotel is fair. The complementory shuttle takes you to and from the airport approx. every 30min. and as they work together with the Hilton next door there are 2 available. In conclusion: If you need a 1 night layover at Phoenix airport this is the perfect value for money. Maybe not for a 2-week vacation.\n"
