      "We stayed one night prior to our early flight at the end of our vacation in Sedona. We did not want to make the two hour drive from Sedona so early in the morning so we booked one night here. I have stayed in airport hotels before so frankly did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were spacious. Front desk was very helpful. We returned our car when we arrived and took the car rental shuttle to the airport and was picked up (in less than 10 minutes). Then in the morning took the shuttle back to the airport. Very seamless and quick service. The breakfast was wonderful. Again we were not expecting much but was very surprised. My husband even personally thanked the woman who was putting out the breakfast since everything was very good and much more than you usually get at an airport hotel. My husand ate so much breakfast he skipped lunch that day. So if you are looking for a great airport hotel this is it. We arrived by plane, early evening and were shuttled by the Holiday Inn van to the hotel. The van arrived in a timely manner and check in at the hotel was provided by a courteous desk clerk. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was included the following morning and was an excellent assortment of breakfast items. Without a doubt I would stay at this hotel again. My stay was two weeks ago and from the moment I arrived the front desk staff members were extremely helpful. They provided excellent recommendations on attractions and then the Manager on Duty, *I believe his name was Bill* provided some restaurants. This was truly an amazing experience and I when I return to Phoenix in a few months, this Holiday Inn has my business.\n",
      "Thank you HI staff! My son and I stayed at the Phoenix airport Holiday Inn so we could catch a 5:30 AM plane. We arrived before 10:00 PM and stood in line behind another party. We waited and waited and waited. The bartender did not know where the receptionist was. Some 20 minutes later she popped from behind a panel and without a word checked us all in. Since we had to leave around 4:00 AM I asked if the bill would appear under our door very early in the morning. I was told that they were delivered very early. Not! I had to ask for a receipt on our way out (fortunately there was a recptionist there).\n",
      "Although I was doubly dissapointed with the service, this Holiday Inn seemed very typical. I wrote a Holiday Inn review, so hopefully the problems I encountered have been resolved for future visitors. We strive to rate properties verus their peers, inthis case upper-mid-level interior-entry motor hotels with elevators.\n",
      "Just what we needed after a long drive from northern AZ and prior to an early start the next morning for the flight back to the east coast. Nothing special, but a clean, well appointed good-size room, quiet and efficient AC, very good soundproofing for the planes, great pool, helpful staff. A bit more than we usually spend but less than most of the competing places equally close to the airport. Not a great neighborhood and not much int he way of dining options but can't really blame the facility for that. We can't rate the breakfast because we had to leave too early. I had a very good stay in a corner king suite with sofa bed, wet bar, two TVs and two a/c units. My travel companion likes the Waffle House chain and there is one in the hotel parking lot. I stayed for two nights, and left a tip for housekeeping the morning after the first night, which the staff did not touch. I left the tip again the morning after the second night at check-out. The funniest thing, when I used the remote to turn off one TV, it turned on the other one! My only complaint, the scrambled eggs (at the hotel, not at the Waffle House) were just so-so. Stayed one night after a long flight. I had emailed hotel before I arrived to sort out the airport shuttle but the phones at the airport seemed to be malfunctioning - or maybe it was me after a long flight! ( No it WAS the phones!!) However contacted the hotel via the info desk and the schuttle was perfect and quick. No problems at checkin and room was clean and comfortable ( and quiet) No problems at all. Breakfast was very good ( except plastic cuttelry but not a major problem) . Swimming pool very welcome way to keep awake and avoid jet lag. The location is isolated with not much around it but that is not uncommon for an airport hotel. Would I say again - Yes After working all week in Northern AZ I drove to Phoenix to spend the night before flying out the next day. I was exhausted and really wanted some quiet time and a good nights sleep. I got that at this hotel. There was a mistake on my booking but the front desk staff took care of it right away. My room was clean, cool and quiet. Starving, I was happy to find a Waffle House on the property so a quick meal and a a nice evening and night in the room. Stayed one night with baby before flight the next morning.\n",
      "Pros: Had a real crib for the baby (not just pack n play). Really easy to fuel and return rental car. Rooms were clean and looked recently remodeled. Staff (for the most part, see below about the reservation) were super friendly and helpful. Bed was SO comfortable, it was lovely. Mini fridge actually kept things at a real fridge temp (important since we had medication that required real refrigeration). Breakfast was standard for the chain and tasty (except I was puzzled by the lack of fruit).\n",
      "Cons: A/C struggled mightily to make room temperature comfortable for us. We turned it to max cool when we arrived and an hour later we were still uncomfortable. It didn't get right until the sun went down a few hours later. Granted, we're from Minnesota so our idea of comfortable is fairly low and it is really hot there in summer, but other rooms on our trip kept up so I don't think it was an unreasonable expectation.\n",
      "Also, when I called front desk to book I specifically asked about a suite with a door between the bedroom area and the living room area and the guy suggested the suite type - after check-in, I was disappointed when the room only had a little tiny half-wall. I mentioned specifically how we like having a way to shut a door between us and where the baby is sleeping so I was surprised the guy didn't understand my request. It was easy enough to follow our other tactic (put her in the corner and rig up the comforter to block light for her), so I wasn't really upset or anything. But, it wasn't what I thought I was getting. So for the record, if you're booking a junior suite, there is NOT a door between the two areas. Stayed here for one night after a long flight into the US. Staff were helpful. The rooms are above-average compared to others in the HI Express chain and we didn't suffer any airport noise. Location is great for a night before/night after flight, but a bit isolated for anything else - only restaurant in the vicinity is a Waffle House which also gave us great service but only offered fast-food options (burgers and fry-ups) - OK for 1 night but not so good if we had been staying around longer. 7/30- 8/10/ 2012\n",
      "Jake Bayer- thanks for making my second stay even more special than the first. I was having such a long Monday and not only was he very courteous, he offered me some drinks from the consession because he knew I didn't like alcohol. The rooms and amenities were up to usually HI Expess quality. I will definitely stay at this hotel anytime I am in Phoenix\n",
      "Actually all the staff members are very friendly.\n",
      "It is so freaking hot in Phoenix, the air conditioner by the door at check in blowing cold air was a added bonus; When you travel as much as I do, it is the little things this the aforementioned that matters. I love the pressure of the shower head as well. This is a a complaint at most hotels Very convenient near the airport. I was initially concerned about hearing planes all night with being near the airport, but it wasn't a problem at all. Great place to stay! We recently stayed at this hotel June 23 & 24 and July 1, at the beginning and end of our Arizona Trip. Our family of our enjoyed our stays. First the hotel is located about 5 minutes from the hotel. When we arrived in Phoenix it picked us up within 10 minutes of our call. it was a quick drive to the hotel, although past a bunch of gentle men's clubs. Not the best scenery. Checkin was quick at this four floor hotel. We were assigned to a fourth floor room.Although the room did not smell of smoking, the hallway does. Our return visit had us on the third floor with a clean smelling hallway. The pool was nice and had pool towels available. The breakfast. Was includes and offered pancakes eggs, Danish And a meat. The orange juice was very weak, not much more then orange flavored water. My wife liked the coffee. The hotel has one washer and dryer. Each cycle was one dollar and detergent was available. The shuttle was nice and got us to the airport in plenty of time. it leaves on the half hour until 11am and then as needed. it will also get you to nearby restaurants and for us the nearby lite rail station to get us to the baseball field. Overall a very nice place for a family and for people like us where it was our first time to the area. Located in the business district it is business person's ideal location being close to many business and roadways that allow a person to get to places easily throughout the Phoenix area. Also being in a close location to the airport it is definitely a place for a person to stay if they had an extended lay over at the phoenix airport. The hotel amenites were good. Hotel does need some tender loving but nothing that a little spit and polish would not take care of. by the way the happy during the week for hotel guests is a nice touch and i would encourage continuance of that service to include sunday evenings. The only other suggestions is to have th breakfast stay open to its posted time of 930. Often the breakfast was closed at 915 and there were still guests coming to enjoy the breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful which made our stay very enjoyable. The room was clean and comfortable with effective air conditioning. \n",
      "The complimentary breakfast was excellent with a great selection of food and beverages.\n",
      "We used the pool which was rarely very busy. A few more parasols would have been nice to provide more shade, as the heat ( in excess of 100F) and sun were intense.\n",
      "For us, the hotel was in an ideal spot for the places we wanted to visit in Phoenix and very convenient for the airport.\n",
      "We will not hesitate to stay here again when we next visit Phoenix. The staff at this hotel were so very nice. The rooms were very clean. We would stay there again. I have stayed at this airport hotel a number of times, mainly because my office is literally across the street. So I just get the airport shuttle service and walk to work when working in Phoenix, and don't need to rent a car. I've always enjoyed my stays at the hotel; it's a holiday inn express and nothing fancy, but the staff is always friendly and great and it just provides you everything you really need when staying at an airport hotel. Some notes:\n",
      "-Free WIFI (although if you stay in rooms at the end of the hallways you will get a really weak signal and will probably need to use the wired option)\n",
      "-Elevator (only one in the place and it takes forever; I would request a room on the 1st floor or 2nd, as there are stairs in the main lobby to take you right up there. Avoid the elevator)\n",
      "-Free breakfast and a happy hour every evening during the week if you are a member of the hotel rewards program (they give you 2 cards for 2 free drinks, I believe)\n",
      "-Free parking\n",
      "-Not much to eat in walking distance (the Hilton next door has a restaurant which is decent and this is what provides the holiday inn room service; there is a waffle house in front of the hotel, but it houses possibly the greasiest food I've ever eaten....that's about all your options within walking distance).\n",
      "-Good TVs with a bunch of channels offered.\n",
      "-Free Shuttle Airport Service (the drivers are really friendly; leaving the hotel is every 30 mins and I've always had good luck with that. But picking you up at the airport is a different story - they usually take forever! You have to call them to pick you up, so I recommend doing it while waiting for your bag or when you get off the plane if you just have a carry-on.)\n",
      "Overall, cheap rates for large rooms. You get great service and a lot of free features as well. I'd recommend it if you stay in the Phoenix airport area. The staff was friendly, the price was right, and the location was excellent. A great place to stay near the airport and the ASU campus. The light rail station was only about 5 miles away, which was very convenient for going into the downtown for a Diamondbacks game. There was only one restaurant within walking distance that we saw, but there were many choices close to campus. I'd definitely stay here again! We spent in this hotel two nights: one after arriving and one before leaving Arizona. Its proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and accessibility made it an attractive choice as a step stone in our travel plans.\n",
      "The airport and the car rental facility are within 15 minutes, fast and easy drive from the hotel, which has its own shuttle service as well. We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and uncomplicated. From the airport, you can call for free the shuttle service, to let them know where they can pick you up.\n",
      "Rooms are spacious, clean, with everything you would need and expect. Although noise was not something we would complain about, it's a fact, probably the extra \"price\" you need to pay for staying there. Other than that, there is nothing except the A/C unit that disturbed our rest. We had to turn it completely off, the fan was far too loud.\n",
      "Breakfast was standard to poor in term of choices, but just fine to get the day started. Probably not my choice for a breakfast restaurant though. What a wonderful find! I will be using this property again for pre and/or post flights from Phoenix. Jake checked us in and gave us the quiet room we had asked for. They had cocktails at happy hour for Priority Club members, as well as snacks. The room was well-appointed. Good air conditioning (which is important when it is 112 degrees outside!), everything you could need in the bathroom, nice large flatscreen TV, etc. They had free wi-fi in the room and a computer in the lobby for checking email or printing boarding passes. Starting at 6 am, they had breakfast as well. I was told it was a \"continental breakfast\" which for me means cereal and danish, but really it was SO much more! There were hot cinnamon rolls, ready-to-make pancakes, a variety of juices, milks and yoghurts, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, etc. Wow! Everything we needed. They even had a park and airport shuttle program. I definitely recommend this hotel! We only spent a night here after a long flight into Phoenix, before setting off on a road trip around the national parks. Our room was on the 4th floor and overlooked an ugly parking lot / industrial area, but it was on the quiet side of the hotel (as requested) so we were happy.\n",
      "The room itself was very spacious with the largest bathroom I've ever seen at a HI. We had an excellent night's sleep on a firm king-size bed. The complimentary breakfast was standard hotel fare and I only ever take a piece of fruit anyway.\n",
      "Our shuttle driver, James, was fantastic. We were only collecting our car the next day so we had no transport, but wanted to visit a local Mexican restaurant. James offered to take and fetch us from there \"just for tips\"', which was much nicer and cheaper than calling a taxi.\n",
      "All in all, a very convenient, comfortable and affordable place to stay in Phoenix. After a long flight from London, we stayed the night at this hotel. Booking in was friendly and quick. The room was a reasonable size and everywhere was very clean. Comfortable bed and not noisy at night. You can get a good light meal next door at the Hilton Hotel. The breakfast was complementary but very good...bacon, scrambled eggs,fruit, yogurts,cereals,toast and cakes. I would stay there again! Over the last 8 months, we have stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels from the East Coast to Arizona and this was by far the only one that was a let down. Although it seems fairly newer, just seemed dark and dreary throughout the building. The room was average and nothing spectacular compared to all the others. \n",
      "Breakfast buffet was alright but it is located in such a narrow area and when you have more than 4 people in the area, it is utter chaos.\n",
      "The only GREAT plus to this place was the front desk clerk. He was extremely friendly to us and recommended a great place to eat dinner just up the road with great steaks. \n",
      "Overall, it's not a bad hotel, but I expected more compared to the others in the chain that we had stayed in. We wanted a hotel near the airport and chose this based on tripadvisor reviews. It was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. We booked a park and fly option and left our car in their parking lot, which worked out very well for us. The hotel is easy to find. The rooms are nice, it was quiet, and the beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was the \"hotel bar\", which is actually in the Hilton Garden Inn next door and owned by the same company (IHG). The pleasant and apologetic bartender did not have the ingredients for our first two cocktail requests and we finally settled for a gin and tonic with lemon because he did not have limes -- so wake up, management! This hotel is close to the airport and easy to get to. We needed to return a rental car...front desk had printed directions for us. It was very easy to get to...only a few mins. drive. There was a computer in the lobby we used to print boarding passes. Our room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was nice. Quick check-in and out. Nice, friendly staff. Free wi-fi in room. Breakfast options were good.\n",
      "We did order room service and it took over an hour to get. \n",
      "Overall, nice option for being close to the airport. I had to catch a flight out of the country early on a Monday. I stayed at this HI Express and the room was perfectly clean, wake-up call on time, and shuttle trip to the PHX airport was timely. The breakfast area was clean and efficient. \n",
      "The room was a suite so it was marvelous. There was so much room!\n",
      "The shuttle driver was exceptionally friendly.\n",
      "I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Stayed here for 3 nights while we went to Brewers Spring Training. Very friendly staff. OK breakfast. Close to Tempe, and university restaurants/scene. Easy access to Rt. 10 to / from the game. Less than 30 minutes from Old Towne Scottsdale. \n",
      "Best part, they have an airport shuttle. I've had to go to this hotel 3 times for business. It's fair, but I have a few complaints. The room service is sloppy, the restaurant is mediocre, the shuttle is not always on time (made me late for work), and they missed my wakeup calls on this last trip 3 days out of 7. My wife and I stayed here to be close to the airport for a next-day departure. \n",
      "The proximity of the hotel to I-10 and the Phoenix Airport car rental facility was most helpful. The friendly and courteous desk attendant provided us with printed directions to the nearest gas station (so we could fill the tank before returning our rental), as well as the route to the rental facility, which was actually at the very next exit off I-10 to the west.\n",
      "The whole facility was clean and inviting. No evidence of wear and tear anywhere.\n",
      "The standard king bed room was spacious enough, equipped with refrigerator and microwave, and very clean and attractive. We had no problem sleeping -- the firmness of the mattress was just right. I did get annoyed a bit by some constant noise from the refrigerator (during regular operation, not just the cooling cycle) but that kind of thing is easily remedied (so long as one does not need to keep anything cool) by pulling the plug on it. Another option is to run the room fan constantly.\n",
      "For those who don't need a fancy meal, there is a Waffle House just a couple hundred feet away. And, of course, the Hot Start breakfast buffet in the hotel lobby, with a wide variety of offerings. We found scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, Cinnamon Rolls, and cereal, among other choices. \n",
      "This HIE ranks right near the top of Holiday Inn Express properties at which we have stayed over the years, and there have been a few -- I am a Priority Club member and tend to look first for this chain when seeking lodging. Absolutely positive experience. The staff is excellent, professional, friendly, helpful. Our room was comfortable, neat and clean with complimentary wi-fi. The free breakfast was good and fresh. The Park and Fly option was very helpful, we found our car to be safe and secure upon our return. The free airport shuttle was right on time and is available for late night airport pickups with just a phone call. I stayed here during a business trip for several days and enjoyed this place. The room was nice and clean, comfortable bed, and wonderful free continental breakfast....no complaints at all!!! It was nice being so close to the airport as well! I like the hotel feel. Friendly staff. Good continental breakfast. The location is convenient for the airport but it is in a poor neighborhood. Not much to do in walking distance and people looks weird.\n",
      "10 minutes drive to west brings you to Tempe where you can find good restaurant.\n",
      "My mattress was beat up so I had to sleep far from the TV and it was acceptable there. Most people sit and sleep in front of the TV and this is where it sinks the most. We spent one night to be near the airport for our morning flight. Staff members were helpful and knowledgeable. Room was typical for HI Express--roomy and pretty clean. Breakfast was again typical--enough variety to have something for everyone. We stayed here just for one night. Very convenient location: it was perfect for next day travel (we arrived from Italy and next day a flight to Hawaii) ... so tired and the bed was very confortable ! Room was clean and quiet!\n",
      "Breakfast was fine, shuttle service great and check in very quickly!\n",
      "A great place to stay for overnight and travel from/to Phoenix We arrived earlier than expected and they gave us our room right away anyway. The room was clean and similar to other HIE. The breakfast was good, as expected. I loved that they had a computer hooked up to a printer, so we could print our boarding passes before going to the airport. We stayed the night we arrived in Arizona and the night before we got our flight home. It was very convenient for us. We will stay here again. The location and the facilities were great.\n",
      "The food was good.\n",
      "The staff was helpful and attentive especially Brian, one of the wait staff. Convenient location. Very friendly staff. Spotless rooms. We left our car for a nominal fee - saved alot on airport parking. Gym, free breakfast was great. Shuttle driver was awesome...he showed up at the airport within 15 minutes with a smile on his face. Highly recommend hotel for next day travel. A totally positive experience. Will stay every time I travel from Phoenix. Airport lodging is usually nothing to write home about, but this H.I. Express beat those odds! We had a pleasant overnight there in a large, comfortable, quiet room with all the comforts of home. (Our traveling companions in a nearby room, though, did have a noisy a/c unit.) And breakfast was great--lots of selections and plenty of food to go around. The staff were friendly and had everything we needed on hand, including printed directions to the rental car return center at Sky Harbor. The neighboring Hilton Garden Inn restaurant was fine too. we arrived late at phoenix, called the hotel from free telephones in the airport, the shuttle was there less than 10min after. Check in was easy, can enjoy the pool at evening, room with king size was comfortable and clean, bathroom too. Good night of sleep, the hotel was not full, and so very quiet. Good breakfast with eggs, sausages, toasts, muffins, pancakes, cereals, fruits, yoghurt... Check out was easy, one shuttle every 30min to go to the airport. The hotel shuttle dropped us to the airport, and we took another shuttle to go to the car rental area.\n",
      "Very good experience in this hotel, for 66$ (reservation one week in advance).\n",
      "Warning : The hotel is far from downtown, there seemed to be anything near so if you want to eat or go out, it can be a problem. I was in awe. This place was not your average Holiday Inn. Very nice staff. Clean, modern.\n",
      "A good example of service/staff would be I mentioned to the front desk I was going to return my rental car to the airport early so I wouldn't need to deal with it in the morning. She immediately pulled out directions from the hotel to the airport rental return, a number to call the shuttle, and instructions exactly where to wait for the shuttle depending on which terminal you were in. Impressive. Stress free! The shuttle is free the airport.\n",
      "The room had a fridge, huge TV, internet...great and safe place to stay. This was a nice, comfortable hotel. Room was clean and free morning breakfast was suitable. Pool was small but clean. We especially enjoyed the bargain of having our car parked there for free up to two weeks while we went on vacation. Shuttle service to Phoenix International Airport was a short 10 minutes from hotel and drivers were impeccablely on time. Great experience and we'll use this hotel again. Check-in was quick and efficient; staff was helpful and friendly; property clean and modern. Free breakfast was worth taking the time to enjoy. Free shuttle service to the airport was timely and courteous.\n",
      "The flat-screen TV got the better of us though, as the remote wouldn't turn it on and there weren't any buttons visible to operate it manually. New batteries for the remote didn't work either. The man who checked us in came with extra remotes (none of which worked), but together we found the touch buttons to turn the TV on manually. Problem was resolved the next morning when a maintenance person came, unhooked and reattached a cable on the back of the TV. We asked for and got a reduction for the inconvenience. This is an excellent hotel, located close to the airport, but without the noise factor. Adjoins a Hilton with full restaurant. Even had a cocktail party for guests; limited selection, but free. I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while I was in Phoenix for my dad's birthday and it was one of the best hotels I've been too. I arrived at the Phoenix airport and called the hotel for their shuttle service. The front desk agent asked for my name and directed me to the pickup location. The driver came within 5 minutes and took us straight to the hotel. The drive to the hotel was very short. Upon arrival the front desk agent had our paperwork and room keys ready so check-in was brief.\n",
      "When we got into our rooms, the lights and A/C were turned on for us ahead of time. It was about 80 degrees at 11pm! But our room was very comfortable. It wasn't freezing or too warm. The rooms were beautiful and everything brand new. The bed was amazing! I wish I could have one at home. I had the best sleep of my life! The rooms were large and it had a 32\" LCD TV.\n",
      "The breakfast in the mornings were also great. Lots of items hot and cold items. They also rotate the hot meats daily which was nice. They have a really cool pancake machine. You just enter the number of pancakes you want and they come out in a couple minutes. The breakfast attendant was also very friendly and helpful. One of my family member arrived late for breakfast but the attendant asked what they wanted and she heated up some eggs and sausage for them.\n",
      "They also offer room services and the prices were incredibly reasonable for hotel room service. It was the same as eating out at a restaurant. Which was very surprising. The late night snacks we ordered were very delicious.\n",
      "I highly recommend this hotel if you plan on staying in the Phoenix area. The staff was very friendly and hepful. I had an excellent vacation at this Holiday Inn. Everything was perfect, the morning breakfast and the entertainment facilities. I would highly recommend staying here, probably one of the best experiences I had. \n",

Camere pulite e spaziose, business center aperto e gratuito per poter navigare e stampare, buon segnale wifi gratuito nella stanza. Nach unserer Ankunft mitten in der Nach in Phoenix haben wir in diesem Hotel übernachtet. Es liegt nur 5 Min fahrt vom Airport und somit ideal wenn man spät landet. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig, die Betten sehr bequem, die Lage sehr ruhig, es hat sogar einen Pool welchen wir nicht ausprobiert haben. Hinter der Reception befindet sich eine Art Kiosk wo Kleinigkeiten auch mitten in der Nacht gekauft werden können. Dies ist für Late-Arrivals sehr praktisch! Zimmer war sauber, TV riesig - ein idealer Start für unsere Rundreise. Pour ceux qui arrivent ou partent de l'aéroport de Phoenix,cet hotel est parfait pour sa proximité(relative),son environnement agréable et calme,son confort et son accueil très professionnel.Le petit-déjeuner est varié.Un ordinateur est à disposition dans le lobby.On peut prendre un repas dans le Hilton voisin.La navette est ponctuelle.Bon rapport qualité-prix.Que des compliments! An- und Abreise mit dem kostenlosen shuttle (ca. 10 min) ebenso problemlos wie der check-in und -out. Ich hatte ein ruhiges und sauberes Zimmer; WLAN kostenlos; das Bett super bequem.\n",

      "EXcellent Hospitality!!!!!!!!!!! We wanted to get out of the snow of Flagstaff & just came down for the weekend. The Staff was soooo nice & friendly to my children & very informative. They played by the pool & had fun in the hot tub!! We will definitely be back for another get away. I thought it was a great place until.....I woke up with bites on my legs and arms, pulled the sheets back and found BED BUGS! I talked to the front desk, they weren't surprised...GM didn't even talk to me. Clerk said, \"Sorry about that\" This is the second time we've come here for business and we would highly recommend this hotel. It is clean, updated, the staff is helpful and friendly, the breakfast is excellent and the service is consistently outstanding. The shuttle service includes free rides to area restaurants: they even had the manager pick us up from dinner last night so we wouldn't have to wait for the shuttle. \n",
      "Sandy, Vancouver BC The Holiday Inn Express was very close to the airport, super clean, and cost effective. While we \"sacrificed\" modern decor and a flat screen, we had a great stay. Staff were super friendly. The room was cozy, clean and comfortable-- no complaints. Free breakfast is also included-- it was pretty decent. \n",
      "Bottom line: You can't go wrong with Holiday Inn Express. Everything about this hotel clicked. Close to airport - check. Fast and free shuttle to airport - check. Large clean lobby - check. Nice front desk staff - check. Workout facility - check. Pool - check. Great and free breakfast - check. Clean and well-appointed room - check. Free internet - check. Comfortable bed - check. Sound proof rooms - check. I stayed two separate nights on either end of a trip to Sedona and it was great both times. An excellent find. We chose this hotel for its location, only 10 mins drive from Phoenix Sky Harbor airport and because it was very cheap! Our room was nice & clean room (fairly small but perfectly OK for a night). Check-in & check-out were both efficient and friendly. Breakfast was fine - fruit, patisserie, breads, cooked items - but coffee was awful & the juice very sickly & sweet. We left very early the next morning so didn’t try the pool but it looked fine. Recommended if you need somewhere to crash before / after a flight. This hotel was great for the money. Great service, attentive. Left our car for 10 days, shuttle to airport. Snacks and any drink you wanted on Wed. evenings. Everything about this hotel, especially their staff, was great. uncovered parking, but safe, with restaurant next door and right off freeway. I would stay here again. Breakfast was nice, ample. 6 Minutes from airport. Super clean. Paid $79. Great breakfast We stayed at this Holiday Inn twice during April, 2010, largely as a result of the Icelandic Volcano which would not allow us to fly home to the UK. We booked at very short notice (Priority Club) and the reception staff could not have been more helpful or sympathetic to our predicament. Rooms were quickly arranged for us, and we ate twice at the nearby and related Hilton Garden Suite. \n",
      "The shuttle service into Phoenix was very efficient, and we had only to dial a special number (45) from the airport in order to get picked up. The service was free, although we did choose to tip the drivers. \n",
      "The breakfast service was good, although the range of cooked food was limited. There was a happy hour each evening, with drinks. We did this twice, although on the first occasion we were served by a very surly youth who was actually only interested in watching the TV and sending text messages on his phone. \n",
      "A good stay, and very good staff. We recently stayed one night after flying in late. I had booked this because I trust the HI Express brand to be clean, comfortable and we like the complimentary breakfasts. It met all our expections. Was well maintained, nice modern hotel. Lovely lobby area. We used the free internet station in the lobby. The breakfast was good for a family - yogurts, fruit, cereals, cinnamon rolls, egg, sausage, biscuits, bagels, fruit juice. We didn't use the pool as we were leaving promptly the next morning, although the pool area looked nice with hot tub. We drove about 10-15 mins into Tempe where we had dinner at Chili's. There was an attached restaurant and nearby pancake/waffle restaurant but we chose to drive about 10 or 15 mins into Tempe to Chili's. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere with great amenities near the airport. we were in phoenix for a week and decided not to book into a hotel for all 7 nights cause you never know what you get . well after 3 nights in another hotel we decided to move into this holiday inn. what a difference the staff is very friendly and helpful. the housekeepers do a wonderful job keeping the room clean and fresh. the pool and hot tub is so clean and towels outside all the time. their breakfast is fresh and delicious. we cant say enough about this hotels. the price is great. we do alot of traveling with hotels and we will stay with this one the next time we go to phoenix. so thank you so much for such an enjoyable stay. Arrived late evening and telephoned the hotel shuttle and it was very quick. Check in was quick and the desk clerks very very curtious and greeted you with a smile. The room was very roomy and house keeping was excellent. The breakfast next morning was excellent and you had a very good variety to choose from. Unfortuneately we were only stayed for one night as we were touring around Arizona. Would definately return. We stayed here for two weeks, March 5-18 2011. The check-in was quick, rooms incredibly clean, wonderful hotel staff. Hotel was very quiet even though it was usually at/near capacity. Pool was usually clean, sometimes towels weren't picked up until the end of the day. Hot tub clean & HOT! \n",
      "The one improvement I would hope for is the beds. I love firm beds, but these are rock hard, and left me with a back ache for the duration of the trip. (I am a sucker for the Sheraton beds, myself.)\n",
      "Front desk staff was very accommodating due to unexpected need to fax things a few times, and pleasant, too. Overnight \"scooter girl\" (drove scooter to work) was awesome, as was the over night guy, I can't believe I forgot his name already. Hubby and I usually chatted in the evenings with him on our way in from smoking (hotel is entirely non-smoking, fine with me.)\n",
      "Breakfast is over PROMPTLY at 9:30, so if that's what you want, be there on time. \n",
      "One night the battery went dead on our door lock, we couldn't get in. They gave us a room across the hall for the time being, it took about an hour and a half to get it working again. It was late at night, and the manager even came in to make sure we could get back in. \n",
      "I would absolutely stay here again the very next time I am in phoenix. The only thing is the cost - not extravagant, but still up there. It was peak season, granted, although I thought it was about $20-30 higher than it should have been, with the W hotel charging the same price. Very comfortable hotel, good sized room, and good breakfast including hot food which is quite unusual in the US. Location is handy for a stop over after flying into the airport as it's only a 10 minute drive. I find that hotels are all about expectations. I often stay at a Holiday Inn Express if I know its going to be for a quick night or two. After their brand relaunch, you can pretty much expect the exact same thing at each property - which can be comforting. In this case, we wanted something close the airport - and with a free airport shuttle. And here is where my biggest complaint was - the shuttle was about 20 minutes late, which stressed me out a bit since I've never flown out of the phx airport and didn't know what to expect with increased security these days. I felt like the front desk should have communicated with the group of people waiting that the shuttle driver was running late. Luckily, when the shuttle came we were in the first group she dropped off. Also, phx airport security was incredibly smooth - the TSA employees were some of the nicest I've seen in the US and we didn't have wait too much at all. Anyways, the hotel room was exceptionally clean. The beds at Holiday Inn Express are great too - I can always count on a good night's rest at these hotels. The free breakfast is always adequate as well. This particular hotel had the new pancake machines - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very easy to use and the finished product was tasty. Didn't get to use the pool but it looked average, and it was outdoors. Their fitness center was also decent and I always love free high speed internet. Other than the issue with the shuttle, I would say its exactly what I would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. We stayed here in a King Suite for 1 night. The shuttle bus arrived very quickly at PHX. Check in was seamless, the young lady was very pleasant. The room was spacious and quiet and catered for what we needed after a long transatlantic flight. We mistakenly thought the sofa bed had not been made up, and the lady at the desk arranged new linen etc to rectify this. We found the bed had in fact been done when we unfolded it, but the extra blankets came in handy nonetheless. (we were too embarrassed and tired to go apologise...sorry!)\n",
      "Convenient breakfast as well. We did not use any other other facilities here. The young lady at the front desk, named Dulce, was above average with her helpfulness and was so very pleasant to deal with. She alone made the stay very pleasant. Rooms were quiet and the entire staff was very pleasant. Highly recommend this hotel. I stayed in this hotel during early November 2010. It was a base for a Arizona trip I took with my dad. It was a pretty good base! We did not spend much time in the hotel during the day as we drove throughout the state. \n",
      "It is not the type of hotel you would want to stay in without a rental car. It has no shops near by it. The airport van is free so you could always take that back and forth! \n",
      "The staff was pretty good. They helped us with directions and gave us some information about Arizona Mills Mall. A few of the front desk ladies were not as friendly as I would hope and took some phone calls over our questions. \n",
      "The room was great! It had a fridge and a microwave and we booked one of the smaller rooms! The beds are great...I love Holiday Inn beds! I just hate the pillows. The pillows were not good and I found it hard to get comfortable with them. \n",
      "The rooms were very clean and that is so important! The bathroom was nice and had a great shower. The rooms were cleaned daily and were usually spotless. \n",
      "I would stay here again. We decided to stay here due to an early flight the next morning. It is a new hotel and very clean. The beds were comfortable, although not pillow top. It is less than five minutes from the airport, yet noise was not an issue. We would choose to stay here again when flying out of Phoenix. Excellent, new hotel with friendly service. I never thought I would be saying this about a Holiday Inn (I hadn't stayed in one for 20 years).\n"
