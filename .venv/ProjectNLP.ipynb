grandi vetrate e splendida vista sulla citt e sul lago michigan bagno e antibagno molto grandi cabina armadio di dimensioni adeguate il personale gentile ed efficiente la camera veniva risistemata pi volta al giorno al nostro arrivo ci hanno portato camera un vassoio di frutta e aperitivo di benvenuto la colazione la carte al mattino presentava una scelta molto ampia e con un servizio di classe la location dellhotel perfetta praticamente sulla michigan avenue la via dello shopping il costo linea con servizi offerti hotel bem localizado estranhei fato de que looby fica andar fiquei em quarto timo de frente para lago existe um carto alertando sobre possvel barulho vento que pode ser um problema mais excelente em tudo tima localizao servio cordial bons quarto com uma bela vista para pier e um lobby espetacular ritzritz ritz topklasse hotel mit freundlicher unaufdringlicher bedienung absoluter toplage im herzen chicago zimmer mit hchsten standard shoppingcenter nebenan einziger wermutstropfen klimananlage zieht zu fest durchs zimmer fr europische gemter da ritz carlton entspricht dem standart den man von dieser kette erwartet e liegt demselben gebude welchem man eine schne shopping mall findet mein zimmer war berraschend gro der service sehr gut ich hatte einen schnen blick ber den see da essen kann ich dem hotel nicht empfehlen teuer und eher enttuschend dy ist kein problem da e der umgebung viele nette restaurant gibt der concierge gibt einem gute tipps da ritz carlton chicago zhlt zu den besten hotel vor ort die lage im sog loop ist sicherlich einer der grten vorteile die e neben den blichen annehmlichkeiten der kette zu genieen gibt im gegesantz zu anderen ritz carltons zb kuala lumpur berlin ist der standard allgemein chicao wohl etwas schwcher da mag dem schon etwas lter wirkendem gebude und auch den im vergleich etwas weniger spektakulr arangierten zimmern liegen der service ist freundlich und zuvorkommend und der business center legt puncto freundlichkeit sogar noch eins drauf nervig ist ein wenig die benutzung der unterschiedlichen aufzge man mus wenn man von draussen kommt zunchst im untergeschoss einen aufzug in og nehmen hier befindet sich dann die rezeption von hier au geht e dann mit wieder anderen aufzgen die stockwerke kling nicht weiter schlimm ist aber etwas ungelenk insgesamt ein gutes businesshotel mit sehr guter lage der michigan road und unmittelbarer nher zum old watertowre einem der wahrzeichen chicago goed hotel niet spannend maar wel erg comfortabel wij hadden een ruime kamer met lake view en de luxe van twee badkamers eerste instantie vonden dat redelijk de top gebruik bleek het reuze praktisch en prettig je loopt elkaar ieder geval niet de weg kwamen uit nyc waar kamer van formaat bezemkast hadden deze kamer daarna aangenaam groot service zijn heel goed en volledig fitness en zwembad zijn top hebben dag ontbeten erg duur voor wat het geen aanrader lobby en restaurant zijn nogal saai en sfeerloos de omgeving zijn echter prima winkels om ontbijt te kopen gezien formaat van de hotelkamer het daar vervolgens prima picknicken ho alloggiato una executive suite stanza molto spaziosa con soggiorno doppio guardaroba e doppio bagno lintero complesso dellhotel per un po vetusto direi che lultimo restauro stato fatto da pi di ventanni il servizio buono e la posizione centrale classico albergone americano con centinaia di stanze se cercate un hotel esclusivo questo non fa per voi la qualit del cibo offerto dal ristorante ritz caf discreto il locale sempre desolatamente quasi vuoto htel cher mais service exceptionnel personnel trs attentionn et de grande confiance trs propreles vestiares du fitness valent la peine dtre vus il sont extraordinaires un seul bmol le concierge

staff made inconvenience effort enthusiasma good sign future back personnel trs sympathique et attentif le chambres sont spacieuses propres et comfortables tout pr de plusieurs attraits parc de la charlesriver fenwaypark fineartmuseum boylston street et newbury street sans avoir prendre la voiture station de mtro et autobus juste en face le restaurant de lhtel eastern standard mrite vraiment un arrt tant pour le petitdjeuner que pour le autres repas en la terrasse est vraiment plaisante et le service est attentif et agrable siamo stati una sola notte questo hotel sulla qualit dellhotel nulla da dire un hotel stelle e si vede purtroppo una posizione lontana dal centro di boston comodissimo per lo stadio e ha la fermata della metro giusto appena fuori il prezzo ovviamente essendo agosto e un hotel di qualit non si pu pretendere sia basso non posso per dare punti questo hotel semplicemente per il problema che abbiamo avuto sulla camera prenotata ebbene avevamo prenotato una camera fenway room double queen con letti queen e la vista sul fenwy park lo stadio dei red sox al nostro arrivo senza comunicarci il cambio della camera ci hanno dato una suite con un solo letto un king e un divano letto con vista strada avendoci dormito avremmo preferito queen alla richiesta di spiegazioni alla reception ci hanno comunicato che era uu upgrade diciamo che pi che un upgrade labbiamo considerato un downgrade dato che il divano letto era decisamente scomodo e non abbiamo avuto la possibilit di fare il cambio camera con quella che avevamo chiesto quindi avviso subito quelli che hanno intenzione di prenotare che anche se la prenotazione la fate dal sito dellhotel specificando il tipo di camera potrebbero non darvi la camera prenotata e un hotel di ottima qualit leggermente decentrato rispetto al centro di boston comunque raggiungibile taxi metro con una piacevole passeggiata di minuti servizi sono di alto livello e caso di problemi il personale si attiva immediatamente nel nostro caso ci era stata assegnata un stanza al piano con affaccio sul red sox stadium bella peccato che sovrastasse la centrale degli impianti dellhotel da cui tracimava un fastidioso rumore di fronte alla nostra rimostranza ci stata immediatamente fornita una stanza analoga al piano consiglio richiedete sempre una stanza al piano pi alto lhotel certamente confortevole ci sono due ottimi ristoranti tra cui il celebre island creek oyster bar dove poter fare pranzo cena e anche colazione e presente un negozio di arte una gioielleria ed anche un divertente bar dove comprarsi ottimi yougurt con frutta biscottini etc etc vicino alla reception disponibile una stanza con servizio internet con due computer una stampante ed un fax le stanze sono belle e ampie la pulizia appare adeguata il prezzo non dei pi economici il rapporto qualitprezzo appare comunque giustificato el hotel est ubicado en un hermoso boulevard e muy cmodo la habitaciones son buenas espaciosas la camas amplias confortables el bao bien equipado tuve algunas dificultades con la conexin de internet wifi una dificultad e que se encuentra algo alejado de la zona cntrica de boston pero tener en cuenta que la estacin del metro se encuentra al lado lo que m recordar e la cordialidad del personal del hotel result que en un olvido inexplicable dej mi billetera dinero documentos tarjetas de crdito en la caja fuerte de la habitacin cuando part rumbo chicago cuando lo advert era tarde ya estaba en vuelo al llegar al aeropuerto de ohare medioda enciendo mi bberry recibo por email el aviso del encargado del hotel la primera hora del da siguiente llegaron toda mi pertenencias chicago qu m puedo agregar la comodidad de mi estada una atencin esmerada sumamente cordial ante un inconveniente que podra haber amargado el resto de mi viaje por los estados unidos ci siamo stati ottobre leleganza la pulizia e la gentilezza del personale ci che colpisce entrando nella hall di questo hotel la camera molto ampia e con vista sulla via principale ha ovviamente un letto king size con poltrone e divano nella zona soggiorno il sonno non disturbato da alcun rumore piedi si raggiunge facilmente il centro avevamo prenotato una stanza kenmore al nostro arrivo ci stata assegnata senza alcun supplemento una magnifica suite n bagno marmo letto king alto comodissimo con lenzuola e cuscini di pregio salottino separato con vista su kenmore dotato di tutti confort pulitissimo e silenziosissimo il personale eccezionalmente cortese sia alla reception che gli addetti ai bagagli servizio camera impeccabile senza costi aggiuntivi rispetto al men del ristorante stazione della metro proprio di fronte complessivamente un soggiorno eccezionale estoy alojado en este momento en el hotel commonwealth entiendo como puede ser que est rankeado como el nmero en boston e absolutamente sobrevalorado el hotel e cmodo con buenas habitaciones camas baos muy buenos tambin la atencin e considerada pero nada m tiene contra su ubicacin si bien boston e pequeo el hotel tiene una estacin del subway al lado eso quita que est alejado otro punto en contra e el funcionamiento del wifi honestamente creo que en el ao que un hotel tenga una buena conexin internet e casi como tener agua caliente aire acondicionado menos un hotel que est considerado como el mejor en boston albergo da stelle con una attenzione al cliente molto alta quando la persona che ha scaricato bagagli dalla macchina nolo ha notato che cerano delle bibite nel bagagliaio ci ha subito offerto un frigorifero addizionale stanza senza costi aggiuntivi per tenere fresco quelle bibite quanto il frigorifero standard essendo automatizzato avrebbe potuto addebitarci delle spese se lo avessimo voluto usare per tenere le nostre bibite elegimos este hotel como fin de nuestras vacaciones no dieron una suite en el pisotodo realmente impecablehabitaciones amplias camas cmodas minutos de la principales atracciones de boston tienen valet parking lo que e muy conveniente en esta ciudadno tiene el desayuno incluido pero muy cerca del hotel hay muchas opciones e un hotel para recomendarpersonal amable el mejor restaurant de la ciudad de comida de pescado el bar muy divertido la stanza junior suite era davvero enorme con una parte separata da tende per far dormire il figliolo su un letto parte la posizione ottima fianco della fermata della metro e due passi dallo stadio dei red sock posizione piuttosto centrale camere spaziose e pulite e staff gentilissimo justo en la parada de kenmore puedes moverte toda partes en el tren excelente servicio atento personal muy centrico lo recomendaria este ao quedado en do ocasiones muy bonito agradable elegante personal e muy amable el trato e personalizado habitaciones amplias cama muy comoda con muchoa almohadones muy limpio situado minutos de los centros de interes arriba de la estacion del tren internet gratis lastima que tengan cafetera en la habitacion hay muchas opciones de alimentacion en el hotel en los alrededores el vecindario e elegante la arquitectura colonial inglesa el hotel est muy bien situado en la zona centro cerca de todo lo interesante de boston tiene justo en la puerta una estacin de metro terminal de autobus urbanos la habitaciones son excelentes baos nuevos amplios habitaciones muy confortables muy bien de limpieza el trato atencin de todos los empleados fue excelente en amabilidad simpata eficiencia sin duda volveremos este magnfico hotel en nuestra prxima visita boston muchas gracias la direccin todo el staff certes l ameublement est un peu vieillot mais la propret de lieux rattrape un peu le dcor le service est irrprochable la brasserie est trs agrable et permet de prendre un excellent breakfast avant de partir visiter la ville le mtro ne peut pa tre plus pr son acc est facile avec ascenseur quand de bagages ceci est trs apprciable nous reviendrons avec plaisir excellent service friendly staff excellent accommodation excellent facility excellent location da commonwealth hotel liegt der boston university und gehnhe de museum fine art direkt vor der haustre ist die ubahnstation der eingangstr wird einem da gepck von sehr freundlichen angestellten abgenommen da die lobby im ersten stock de gebudes liegt der service ist kompetent und wie meist amerika sehr freundlich wir hatten ein eckzimmer da sehr gerumig war ebenso da bad im hotel gibt e eine hypermodern eingerichtete oysterbar und ein restaurantbar dem auch gefrhstckt werden kann mit der ubahn ist man schnell downtown bzw flughafen mit umsteigen minuten nous avions visit cet htel pour de amis lorsque nous habitions boston et notre impression tait bonne nous avon pas quelques jours mon mari et moi et nous navons pa dus du tout le service la chambre le rapport qualit prix et lemplacement sont parfait recommander le quartier de fenway et un super endroit et il de ta de restaurant trs bons juste ct ottimo hotel veramente buon servizio molto gentili stanza grande pulito lunico inconveniente che un po decentrato rispetto al centro di boston bisogna prendere il taxi lautobusmetro per andare centro al porto di boston per lhotel buono davvero lhotel si trova kenmore square fermata della subway green line metri dallingresso dellhotel ridosso dello stadio dei red sox della boston university e poche centinaia di metri da newbury street la via con negozi pi eleganti di boston e locali pi ricercati nei tavolini allaperto dei locali sulla newbury veri bostoniani della upper class si mischiano ai turisti reduci dallo shopping mentre nei pub covo storico dei tifosi di baseball gli studenti si confondono con fan dei red sox di fronte enormi bicchieri di birra nel complesso il clima assai diverso rispetto alle zone di maggiore frequentazione turistica che comunque restano portata di mano se si utilizza la metropolitana qui si respira lo spirito della citt senza troppe forzature ad uso dei visitatori lhotel complessivamente offre un servizio adeguato al livello di prezzo proposto che comunque impegnativo linea con quello di altri hotel della stessa categoria citt allarrivo alle del pomeriggio la camera non era ancora disponibile e le pulizie erano corso tutto lhotel per avere disposizione immediatamente una camera abbiamo accettato un upgrade rispetto quella inizialmente prenotata il personale della reception ci ha anche proposto altri upgrade del servizio senza insistenze particolari goed hotelnette kamersnet personeelwel duur met ontbijtlunch en dinerik

friendly thoroughly enjoyed loved stay already decided stay downtown houston definitely hotel well staying experience benefit upgrading executive level next time ill get regular room ive enjoyed regular room executive suite door hanger order inroom complimentary breakfast morning instead requesting one front desk decided complimentary breakfast buffet big mistake crowded barely found place sit e handelt sich nicht um ein fnf sterne hotel und ist schon ein bisschen die jahre gekommen aber da zimmer war tadellos und da personal sehr freundlich insbesondere die kostenlosen nachmittagsdrinks fand ich sehr gelungen ich wrde jederzeit wieder buchen da magnolia hotel liegt sehr zentral downtown houston direkter umgebung gibts einige restaurant allerdings ist downtown houston insgesamt eher langweilig die einzige interessante mglichkeit zum einkaufen ist ein macys da war dann auch vomzum flughafen iah braucht man ca minuten leider verfgt da hotel nicht ber einen kostenlosen shuttlebus die fahrt zum flughafen mit einem taxi kostet ca u hier bietet da hotel aber auch den transfer mit einem eigenen fahrzeug ggf gerumiger und sauberer die zimmer waren sehr nett eingerichtet und gerumig mit schner aussicht auf houston da kostenlose frhstck war schon sehr amerikanisch wenig auswahl und kaffee au styroporbechern parfait pour celles qui veulent participer linternetionnal quilt festival de houston de nombreuses laurates sont hberges et le rencontres sont trs instructives autour du petit djeuner quelques bloc seulement du concention center george brown et lhappy hour est dlicieux no alojamos tres noches en este hotel bien situado con buenas intenciones pero al llegar en la noche la habitacion estaba arreglada nunc la limpiaron la toallas por el suelo el bao sin asar un asco la verdad trs mdiocre peu recommandable lhotel est mal entretenu robinets casss jacczzi hors dusage piscine et petite salle de sport sans surveillance le personnel est compos de beaucoup dtrangers stagiaires sans soin et ne comprenant pa bien le client nous somme trs dus htel de pitre qualit sans rapport avec leur publicit schade da diesis hotel nicht einem besseren ort steht eine langweilige stadt wie houston habe ich noch nicht erlebt sogar da der narbe liegende einkaufscenter hatte nicht mehr al zwanzig leute einem samstag nachmittag und e war kein feiertag prezzo conveniente colazione un po scarna inclusa wireless illimitato posizione comodissima per chi deve sogggiornare downtown personale cortese e disponibile unica pecca arredamento delle camere un po datato ci ampiamente compensato dai vantaggi dellhotel zimmer waren gut ausgestattet und auch da bad war schn gro da frhstck lie zu wnschen brig auerdem gab e ein pool im hotel man auch braucht bei dem klima houston fr den preis ist da magnolia sehr gut und lsst nicht viele wnsche brig e lag sehr zentral und man konnte alles sehr schnell erreichen doch da parken war sehr teuer la ubicacin muy buena cerca de main street que e en donde queda todo hay tranva para llegar otros lugares en la ciudad minutos pie del toyota center del minute maid arena el hotel cuenta con desayuno la habitaciones son amplias cmodas veces los elevadores se dan abasto el servicio en el lobby fue muy bueno falta de atencin pocas ganas de colaborar pero en realidad falta mucha atencin hoy en da todo estaba indicado bastante claro hay puesto de taxi frente al hotel la vuelta de la esquina da magnolia ist direkt downtown houston die lage ist fr geschftsleute sicherlich fr privatreisende sollte man bedenken das man downtown nicht allzuviel unternehmen kann die meisten restaurant downtown sind wochenende geschlossen da parken ist auch nicht einfach das man den valet parking service fr pro tag anspruch nehmen sollte andererseits gibt e keine grsseren staus und man ist schn zentral gelegen und kommt berall schnell hin da haus hat stockwerke und ist ein historisches hochhaus da interneur ist sehr elegant und der service wirklich berragend wonach wir auch fragten un wurde mit allem geholfen da frhstck war reichhaltig und im preis inclusiv absolut weiterzuempfehlen da hotel befindet sich downtown der nhe de minutemaidparks allerdings gibt e nicht viele dinge die man downtown unternehmen kann e gibt zwar einige mall der nhe doch nicht mit sehr grossem angebot die zimmer sind sehr gerumig allerdings mussten wir da un zuerst zugeteilte zimmer tauschen da e einer dunkelkammer glich schrank direkt vorm fenster badezimmer modern eingerichtet und ebenfalls gerumig happy hour der bar sowie bedtime cooky buffet abend nette gesten wenn auch nicht unbedingt notwendig frhstcksbuffet war sehr nchtern e gab nicht platz fr jedermann einige mussten kleinen beistelltischen ihr frhstck einnehmen het magnolia hotel een prima hotel waarvan wij eerder al gebruik hebben gemaakt deze keer viel de kamer ons tegen de kamer erg donker waardoor overdag volop licht moesten aanmaken de dikke donkere gordijnen hingen gedeeltelijk voor de ramen en voor een derde raam een kast geplaatst het bureau kon niet gebruikt worden omdat het een donkere hoek geplaatst en er geen bureaulamp verder er slechts stoel aanwezig waardoor altijd iemand op bed liggend moest lezen wij hebben weer voor magnolia gekozen omdat de vorige keer een lichte kamer aan de voorkant hadden met uitzicht en met zitplaatsen voor meerdere personen de kamer en badkamer waren verder comfortabel en netjes maar bovenstaande toch een behoorlijke tegenvaller de kamer bood uitzicht op een binnenplaats met omliggende gebouwen die al veel licht weghielden vandaar dat ik het onbegrijpelijk vind dat bij de inrichting van de kamer geen rekening gehouden met de geringe lichtinval het uitzicht vonden wij minder belangrijk omdat het grootste deel van de dag afwezig waren maar na een vermoeiende dag zou het prettig zijn geweest om een makkelijke stoel even bij te komen en ieder geval te profiteren van het heldere daglicht dat er nog volop heel jammer de kamer die bij een eerder bezoek hadden echt super verder er op het hotel niets aan te merken bediening service en eten prima helemaal niets op aan te merken mooie grote kamer ontbijt niet heel uitgebreid maar voldoende namiddag happy hour gratis shuttle van het hotel naar convention center en terug mooi zwembad met wirlpool op het dak van hotel vriendelijke bediening uitstekend design hotel downtown dichtbij convention centre lopend ong blokken min goede service towncar voor gebruik binnen downtown goed ontbijt gratis drankjes happy hour ruime kamers goede bedden aanrader based website thought would nice romantic hotel spend night night town great view overthetop service wrong clean ended crowded night obvious staff facility

reprendrons sans hsitation really nice stay hotel nice staff location good comfort easy acces car however parking bit expensive good service employee contact highly recomend hotel da hotel liegt downtown houston e ist nett eingerichtet und bietet einige annehmlichkeiten wir waren wochenende fr nacht dort und samstag nachmittag gibt e der bar stunde happy hour mit freigetrnken pro person ganz nett ist weiterhin ist da kostenlose frhstck im vergleich zu anderen amerikanischen hotel echt gut warmes wie auch kaltes buffet sind inklusive der hotelpool dach ist nett allerdings eher klein und da e im sommer zu hei houston ist ist e nicht sehr angenehm sich dach aufzuhalten da magnolia hat etwas den charme vergangener zeiten die zimmer sind komfortabel mit einem grossen badezimmer da frhstcksbuffet ist wenn man wie ich zwei wochen stck dort verweilt sehr langweilig und nicht besonders gesund typisch amerikanisch auf dem dach gibt e einen swimmingpool der sehr zu empfehlen ist nach langen heissen und feuchten tagen houston auerhalb der ac bereiche da spa ist funktionell und alles wesentliche vorhanden value money bel hotel au centre de houston downtown dans un quartier qui se

la propret la disponibilit lefficacit et la gentillesse de tout le personnel trs bien plac calme cet hotel au pas glorieux nous charm merci expdia pour ce conseil dans un de gratteciel le plus ancien de houston cet hotel offre une trs belle prestation je dplore juste le manque de lumire naturelle une chambre ct cour le prix payer pour viter le bruit de la rue je suppose ne pa manquer la terrasse au eme tage avec vue sur la ville et piscine peu profonde pour nager estava em reforma ma assim mesmo o apartamentos estavam isolados e muito bons e atendimento referencial de boa qualidade bestens gelegenes modern gestyltes hotel im zentrum von houston tx gut erschlossen mit metro strassenbahn und bus aber auch mit dem auto gut und einfach erreichbar kein eigentliches restaurant im hotel der nhe gibt e aber restaurant zb little italy pool auf der dachterrasse und fitnessraum mit modernsten gerten wird sehr benutzt tiptop roomservice wir waren nur fr nacht dort der standort bietet div mglichkeiten um die stadt kennenzulernen man darf allerdings nicht die taxikosten unterschtzen da frhstck war fr europ verhltnisse ziemlich drftig fr ein sternehotel ansonsten waren wir aber sehr zufrieden da hotel ist sehr schn da frhstck und da cookiebuffet ok allerdings konnte un der rezeption niemand sagen wieviel e kostet den service internet via tv zu nutzen wir haben dann den pc im stock genutzt al der ausfiel und wir nach einer alternative fragten sagte un der rezeption niemand das e im stock ebenfalls ein computer gibt den man nutzen knnte da valetparken kostet wir haben im parkhaus um die ecke geparkt dort stehen brigens auch die valetgeparkten auto fr tag rgerlichsten war aber das un abgebucht wurden fr die benutzung der minibar obwohl wir von dort nichts hatten wir haben dem der rezeption widersprochen da geld wurde trotzdem abgebucht auf unsere beschwerde via emailformular gab e keine antwort da hotel ist sehr schn da frhstck und da cookiebuffet ok allerdings konnte un der rezeption niemand sagen wieviel e kostet den service internet via tv zu nutzen wir haben dann den pc im stock genutzt al der ausfiel und wir nach einer alternative fragten sagte un der

tag rgerlichsten war aber das un abgebucht wurden fr die benutzung der minibar obwohl wir von dort nichts hatten wir haben dem der rezeption widersprochen da geld wurde trotzdem abgebucht auf unsere beschwerde via emailformular gab e keine antwort gleich nach der ersten nacht wollten wir einen zimmerwechsel da die aussicht der vierten etage nicht beindruckend war dieser grund hatte gereicht und wir haben sofort ein zimmer der etage erhalten da frhstck hat keine wnsche offengelassen bagel rhrei cerealien obst saft joghurt etc nachmittag gab e sehr leckere cooky und milch free sehr schade war das der pool auf dem dach nicht genutzt werden konnte hier waren die schden aufgrund de hurikans ike zu gro und da dach leider noch nicht wieder instandgesetzt da einzige wirklich bemngelt werden knnte ist da valetparken weil mit dollar die nacht einfach zu viel wenn man die umgebung etwas erkundet findet man eine mglichkeit fr sechs dollar die nacht sein fahrzeug zu parken ein sehr empfehlenswertes hotel lage und zimmer sind sehr gut da hotel ist sauber und die betten sehr komfortabel freundlichkeit und hilfsbereitschaft de personal deutlich verbesserungswrdig valet parking

hotel abbastanza ok camere troppo buie e se piove non hanno ombrelli disposizione dei clienti una vergogna per un hotel di questo livello da magnolia ist ein tolles hotel da gebude ist die ehemalige zentrale von mobiloil e ist behutsam restauriert alles war sauber und die zimmer ruhig da frhstck kostenlos fr amerikanische verhltnisse absolut okay die lage ist prima um downtown dallas zu erkunden ich wrde jederzeit wieder kommen preisleistungsverhltnis stimmt aloj una noche en magnolia dallas ha sido sin duda una de la mejores experiencias hoteleras de mi vida desde el amable eficaz personal de front desk la copa del director el buffet de galletas el desayuno la habitacin la ubicacintodo perfecto por un problema del telfono son el despertador el director todd personalmente pidi disculpas compr un billete nuevo de avin sin cargo puso una limo con choffer al aeropuerto impresionante gracias por todo este hotel cuenta con una inmejorable ubicacin cerca de lugares histricos tiendas departamentales el centro financiero de dallas adicionalmente el edificio ha sido reconstruido de manera que brindan grandes comunidades en un edificio antiguo lo cual lo hace muy acogedor muy buena relacin costobeneficio este hotel e una buena opcin para gastar mucho estar en el centro de dallas la atencin e agradable pero se nota la falta de m personal la habitacin e cmoda pero muy oscura el edificio est rodeado de edificios alto la ventanas son pequeas adems la iluminacin interior e escasa el desayuno buffet e un poco justo se sirve en un rea llamada club que e como dice un tipo bar por lo que e muy cmodo el sbado ofrecen omelet al gusto por usd adicionales recomiendo escoger el hotel por el desayuno el hotel est cerca de los grandes mall por lo que e recomendable para shopping est relativamente cerca del dallas market center est dentro de la millas del hotel para que te lleven en un shuttle sin costo incluye propina para el conductor en general e un hotel que se recomienda por su relacin costo beneficio pero nada m elegimos este hotel por la situacin en el historic district la cercana dealey plaza el floor museum el servicio encantador con servicio de aparcacoches parking de pago la habitaciones bien el desayuno estupendo como dije la situacin inmejorable adems hay bastantes restaurantes cercanos estupendos da magnolia hotel liegt sehr guter lage mitten der stadt wir haben alle sehenswrdigkeiten vom hotel au zu fuss ermittelt die zimmer sind sehr gross und die betten sind bequem da frhstck war okay und abend gab e gratis einen drink und erdnsse usw unten im hotel befindet sich ein starbuckscoffee fanden wir super nur da parken war ein teuer wie allen grossstdten leider war mein zimmer nicht schn wie ich e mir auf grund de wunderbaren gebudes erwnscht htte die jalousien lieen sich nicht mehr hochziehen bzw die lamellen konnte ich nicht verstellen der ausblick war auch eher trostlos toter vogel auf dem nachbarsims mein zimmer war nicht mit den angboten von hellen groen zimmern auf der homepage zu vergleichen ich musste mich woche mit knstlichem licht arrangieren nettes und hilfsbereites personal da zimmer wurde wirklich tglich gereinigt durch die

anywhere prime location across public garden convenient restaurant theater shopping beautifully appointed room outstanding service really splurge well worth cest un hotel splendide mais trs cher nous avions un prix pour une confrence laquelle jassistait mais coutait nuit pour le reste comme la tl et droit devant le fameux parc de good hunting el hotel estaba mal pero despus de haber ido otros four season ste ltimo pareci el peor de todos el lobby estaba muy bien pero los pasillos para ir la habitaciones estaban muy bien cuidados tambin la habitaciones eran decentes cmodas pero carecan del lujo de un hotel de cinco estrellas en los baos haba baera slo ducha por otro lado la ubicacin est muy bien ya que se encuentra en la mejor parte de boston al mismo tiempo en un lugar bien tranquilo chambre impeccable personnel la hauteur et localisation idale que dire de plus si ce nest que tout cela un prixun parc pour marcher en face le boutique et grand magasins proximit le sexcteur est peut tre moins connu que celui du port ou de fenouil hall mais vaut vraiment la peine dtre connu de toute faon boston rien nest vraiment loin et la circulation nest plus selon moi le cauchemar que ctait dans le pas recommander sans hsiter da hotel ist sehr gut gelegen viele sehenswrdigkeiten sind zu fuss gut erreichbar auch taxi hat e immer gengend die zimmer sind von der grsse io und sehr gut ausgestattet der nacht ist e ruhig fr den schlaf dienlich ist frhstck ist ordnung schade das e kein buffet gibt ausser sonntag der sonntagsbrunch ist jedoch hoffnungslos berlaufen e scheinen viele bosten diesen event zu kennen der fitnessraum ist gut ausgestattet und rund um die uhr verfgbar fr internet gibt e eine kostlosen etwas langsamer und einen zahlbaren zugang erfreulich der kostenlose zugang ist absolut gengend da hotel ist super zentral gelegen und man kann berall zu fu hingehen viele zimmer schauen auch auf den park die mitarbeiter sind sehr zuvorkommend und die zimmer sind sehr gemtlich mit allen ntigen komfort den sonntagsbrunch mus man mal gehabt haben da ambiente ist sehr schn da buffet umfangreich frische crepe und waffeln werden zubereitet der preis fr den brunch ist schon etwas hoch aber einmal mus man e gemacht haben nuits aux four season en arrivant de france cest le super plan pour se remettre du dcalage la chambre tait trs bellesans fausse note le bar trs agrable et dcontract et le parcs deux minute un vrai plus en plus nous avon partag lhotel avec le joueurs de manchester united qui tait en tourne leur prsence qui aurait dchain le foules en france tait plus que discrte et il faut reconnaitre que ce joueurs lorsque nous le croisions ce qui du arriver au moins fois nous avions le mmes horaires taient dune discrtion et dune gentillesse absoluemme le fan qui le attendaient la sortie taient sympas et jamais le portiers nont eu un geste dhsitation quand nous rentrions en mme temp que le joueurs cette anecdote rendu notre sjour encore plus agrable et fille inond le facebook de s copains de photo de joueurs boston cest trop cool hotel liegt direkt park ideal wen man vorm arbeitstag etwas joggen stadtzentrum und alle top lden sind minuten zu fuss zu erreichen die zimmer war sehr rumig genauso wie da gut ausgestattete badezimmer und mit einem wunderschnen blick direkt auf dem park die schallisolierung ist gut man kann gut schlafen man ist vom straenlrm gut geschirmt schne restaurant sind um die ecke zu finden zum beispiel troquet restaurant der tagungsraum im obergeschoss war auch sehr schn und hell mit fenstern auf dem park service war insgesamt gut boston ist eine tolle stadt und diesis hotel passt absolut dazu der service ist fantastisch da personal hoch professionell die zimmerausstattung geschmackvoll besonders hervorzuheben ist der service den die concierge leisten auch der wellness und fitnessbereich ist wirklich einwandfrei da hotel verfgt ber ein restaurant da eine sehr gute qualitt bietet freitag und samstag abend spielt live ein jazztrio und e wird ein dessertbuffet geboten da parken ist zwar teuer dollar pro nacht aber durch den valetservice auf jeden fall gerechtfertigt ich habe auch viele kinder mit eltern im hotel gesehen da hotel ist zwar sehr hochpreisig bietet aber offensichtlich immer wieder mal gnstigere preise war auf krzlicher geschftsreise vom four season boston sehr angetan ich bin mit redeye von der westkste kommend schon um h im hotel gewesen und verstndlicherweise war da zimmer noch nicht fr earlycheckin bereit die reception war sehr hilfreich und gestattet mir mich im spabereich fr meine meeting bereit zu machen der fitnessraum ist zwar etwas klein aber gut ausgestattet da zimmer war grosszgig und sehr bequem wenn auch nicht unbedingt super modern da four season boston ist direkt boston public common gelegen dem sehr beliebten bostoner stadtpark mitten im zentrum von wo au sich alle sehenswrdigkeiten der city bequem und schnell zu fuss erreichen lassen und orte wie cambridge oder der flughafen logan per direkter ubahnlinie anbindung da hotel besitzen die zimmer zur parkseite bieten einen wundervollen ausblick ber den weitlufigen boston common bi hin zum exklusiven beacon hill viertel die newbury street mit ihren zahlreichen geschften restaurant und bar sowie da grosse copley square einkaufszentrum sind wenigen gehminuten erreichbar klassischem design gehalten und mit allem erdenklichen komfort und der neuesten technik ausgestattet lassen die sehr gerumigen zimmer keinerlei wnsche vermissen da zuvorkommende personal ist bestens geschult und kmmert sich wirklich um jeden wunsch der gste allerdings sind die preise fr smtliche dienstleistungen ebenso wie die preise im restaurant und der lounge und dem spa schon sehr hoch aber auch service hat usa nun einmal seinen preis und hier gibt e nichts eifer und den mglichkeiten zu bemngeln jedenfalls verglichen mit dem mandarin oriental dem taj oder dem ritzcarlton fhle ich mich im four season immer irgendwie besser aufgehoben und die atmosphre dort spricht fr sich desidero fare una premessasono una estimatrice della catena four seasonsho avuto il piacere di visitarli diversi luoghi nel mondorappresentano per una garanzia questo caso sono costretta ad esprimere la mia insoddisfazionee un hotel ordinariotroppo impersonalegode per di una posizione eccellente jojo\n"
